You are using a single `F` type, that is supposed to implement `for<\\'a> Future<Output = S<\\'a>>`, where in reality you have a `for<\\'a> F<\\'a>: Future<Output = S<\\'a>>` type.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you change the `AsyncF` trait to be something like the following:\\r\\n```rust\\r\\ntrait AsyncF<\\'a, Input>: Fn(Input) -> Self::Future {\\r\\n    type Future: Future<Output = Self::Out>;\\r\\n    \\r\\n    type Out;\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nimpl<\\'a, F, Fut, In> AsyncF<\\'a, In> for F\\r\\nwhere\\r\\n    F: Fn(In) -> Fut,\\r\\n    Fut: Future,\\r\\n{\\r\\n    type Future = Fut;\\r\\n    type Out = Fut::Output;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\nThen your example [works](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=a0db8d120af26cbcab4e20dc309b4adc). Though I want to warn you that such traits are a pain to work with and especially extend.\\r\\n\\r\\n----\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for `for<\\'a> async move |x: &\\'a ()| -> &\\'a ()` kind of thing, I think it generally desired, but was ruled out of the scope of the RFC. So, if we\\'ll ever add it, it would first need its own RFC.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appears that async closures are currently in a very rough shape ([eg](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b8c0a01b2b651416f5e7461209ff1a93a98619e4/compiler/rustc_ast_lowering/src/expr.rs#L962)) so a good place to start would probably be to fix/complete the implementation of async closures first.<|endoftext|>Thank you very much. I have seen people vaguely complaining about the primitive state of async closures but besides this niche case I have found that they have worked pretty well. Is there an issue tracking the problems with them?<|endoftext|>There is a tracking issue for async closures: #62290<|endoftext|>Found an ICE involving this feature: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/103736\\r\\n\\r\\n(Maybe we could use an `F-closure_lifetime_binder` tag?)<|endoftext|>Suggestion: could it be allowed to elide the return type of an explicitly higher-ranked closure when it is `()`? Currently, Rust allows eliding `()` returns in all other function signatures, even when nothing else can be elided.<|endoftext|>@Jules-Bertholet I don\\'t think it\\'s a good idea, we may want to allow inferring return type in the future, just like with normal closures.<|endoftext|>@WaffleLapkin \"Infer return type when it is `()`\" should be forward-compatible with \"infer return type always.\"<|endoftext|>@Jules-Bertholet oh, I misunderstood this as \"make `for<> || { some expression... }` return type always `()`, same as with normal function\". Inferring it is probably fine.<|endoftext|>It appears that this will not work well for returning closures as their type can not be explicitly specified as a closure return type. This is likely known but I think worth pointing it out. This will however work for return types that you can specify.\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\nlet f = for<\\'a> |a: &\\'a u8| -> impl \\'a + Fn() -> &\\'a u8 {\\r\\n    || a\\r\\n};\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nerror[[E0562]](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/error_codes/E0562.html): `impl Trait` only allowed in function and inherent method return types, not in closure return types\\r\\n --> src/main.rs:5:36\\r\\n  |\\r\\n5 |     let f = for<\\'a> |a: &\\'a u8| -> impl \\'a + Fn() -> &\\'a u8 {\\r\\n  |                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n[Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=7aa83bd601924e751507bc7062715256)<|endoftext|>@kevincox: I believe that is a general limitation of what return types you can write when declaring closures, and not related to this RFC.',\n",
