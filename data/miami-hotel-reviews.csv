After trying to get in touch with them and Booking.com to no avail, I contacted credit card server (BofA) to start a dispute.  I was advised to forward email to them indicating they would not be providing services as promised.  I returned to original confirmation indicating free cancellation before arrival date so I canceled with Booking.com as they allegedly are still in business for next several days.

I lost my room key and when I asked to be let into my room, the staff member on duty was incredibly rude and unhelpful. Despite providing evidence of my recent transactions at the hotel and showing that the names of my friends matched the people staying in the room, the staff member refused to let me in and was extremely dismissive. I was left stranded and frustrated, and the staff member's lack of empathy and professionalism was truly disappointing. I would not recommend staff member, I believe called Theodore, to anyone looking for a positive and welcoming experience. Aside of this, cleaning was also a struggle since I believe not once they came to clean our room, we were the ones calling all the time to see if someone could provide clean towels. The shower was not comfortable at all and no water pressure at all. Not once I felt entirely cleaned. Phone didn’t work half the stay. And so on.   Aside of this, it’s perfect location if you are planning to be in Wynwood area for a short time, affordable for what it is, relatively new so it’s modern, cool pool but drinks were not strong at all unless you did on the rock, the other members at the Front Desk were usually attentive. They intentionally hired cute looking guys to receive guests at the main entrance, that was funny even tho just the blue eyes caucasian was nice to everybody, there was another tanned guy who was not nice at all and wouldn’t even press the button to open the door anytime guests arrived.

We stayed here only because we had a very long layover for an international flight, and the hotel is actually in the airport. But despite it being in the airport it was actually fairly hard to find.

Lauded by peer reviewed journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine, praised by the press, including the Today Show, and attended by over 100 000 guests, a stay with us will change your life.",5.0,#1 of 1 special resort in Miami,"I researched wellness retreats for over a year and chose Pritikin because they are a medically supervised facility. Having gone to ""Biggest Loser"" type retreats in the past, I wanted to make sure I was medically supervised while following a program. Pritikin was highly rated. The resort, first of all, is beautiful. I am a former hotel manager and loved my room and the view of the lush grounds which were immaculately groomed. The room was clean and a short walk to the main building. But they failed miserably at protecting my health - the very thing I came to improve - by their negligence in training the staff and they served me ALL 3 of my allergens - gluten, sesame, and soy resulting in illness.   The thing I need to stress above all else is the utter lack of safety protocol regarding my food allergens. Their website clearly states they can accommodate them, and I emailed my coordinator more than 2 months in advance of my arrival. She lost my first email from December 3rd so I sent it again on December 26th for my January 29th arrival.  I was promised a sit down with the chef and that my special needs would be taken care of. No chef was there upon my Sunday arrival so I was given a menu which listed allergens in the far right column. I quickly found out, thanks to a chatty server, ""not to trust"" that paper because the ""marketing department and kitchen staff were not on the same page"" and there was misinformation (for example, an apple crisp dessert was listed as gluten free but was actually made with a whole wheat tortilla). This was shocking to me but was foreshadowing of what was to come. I was thankful when I finally was able to get a meeting with Chef Victoria on Monday afternoon. She sat with me for almost an hour, going over every meal of every day for a whole week, highlighting what I could eat and noting the modifications they would make for me (like a gluten free crust for the pizza). She told me that this menu was going to be hanging in the kitchen along with my photo so the whole staff knew of my allergens. I brought this highlighted menu to every meal.  I felt safe. Unfortunately, this was not carried through by the team as detailed below. Chef Victoria was lovely by the way, and made sure to let me know she was available if I had any questions or concerns.   Three days into my stay at Pritikin the unpleasant side effects began.  I developed a rash all over my belly. The doctor there (Dr Gonzales who is also lovely) stated it was 100% an allergic reaction and told me to only try one new food a day. I found out during my next consultation with the nutritionist (Superstar Lon) that they use SOY MILK in their oatmeal. This was not something I was made aware of during my consultation with the chef and I had been eating the oatmeal every day. Shortly after stopping the oatmeal (and taking several doses of Benadryl) the rash resolved. As a side note, during the women's health luncheon with Dr Frugé someone asked about soy & women's health and Dr Frugé said some women need to watch their soy intake to which I shared the oatmeal story - not only was Dr Frugé surprised but many of the women in the lecture said they were avoiding soy for health reasons and had no idea the oatmeal had soy. I sent an earlier email with a suggestion to put a sign there for a warning since many women avoid soy.   My next allergen exposure was one that almost sent me to the hospital. I was glutened on February 8th while under the supervision of the dining room manager Roberto. When I got back to my room I vomited violently for over an hour. I emailed Chef Victoria and asked if maybe there was something in the salad that had gluten (there were parmesan crisps, turns out they were made with wheat panko!!) and she stated she had a special gluten free salad prepared for me that I had not been served. The next morning I felt the ""gluten hangover"" and mentioned to Dr Gonzales that I was very ill the night before. I sent an email to VP Jamie explaining what had happened and copied the chefs.   The next day Ricardo, a dining room supervisor,  approached me and said he heard I had gotten sick (they obviously passed on my email) and told me to ask for him at every meal and he would make sure I was taken care of.    Two days after the gluten episode on 2/10 Ricardo sat me outside per usual and served me my soup & salad. I was brought the “catch of the day” which was very obviously made with sesame seeds in the sauce. The server dropped it off and left quickly so I brought it back inside and Ricardo asked me what was wrong, I said I wanted to speak with the chef; Ricardo took the plate and said he would take care of it and brought me out a new piece of fish with no sauce and said to me “You know sesame seeds are gluten free!” I said Yes, I knew that, but ""I am allergic to sesame seeds"" to which he said ""Oh.""  It was apparent he had NOT been told exactly what my allergens were. At this point I was gobsmacked. The system you have in place totally failed. I was argued with about sesame seeds being gluten free? By the person who was told to look after me and was not properly trained on exactly what my allergens were after I reported the other incidents? Not once, not twice, not three times - but actually FIVE times (a cup of cappuccino and a soy-sauce laden rice were two other times I was served carelessly but caught it)   The saddest part about all this was the lack of empathy I got from the resort after my complaints. It was not unlike the lack of empathy shown to me when I was given a ""written"" quote and they didn't honor it because they made an error (in my favor). I am a top performing salesperson and when I make a quoted error my company backs me up as a show of integrity. It was misrepresentation of price and I was fought with so hard by the President on it, that I acquiesced because I wanted to come here so badly for my health. He ""met me halfway"" but did not honor the quote I was given, even though another member of the team ASSURED me they would honor it (resulting in me having to change my flight then change it back 3 times) - these calls are recorded and they seemed to have missed the one with their team member promising they would have to honor it because they had done so before. Bad business practice that was followed up with lack of care.    I asked for compensation for not having the same illness-free experience everyone else paid for and received. My email request was ignored. I was told twice, once by Roberto and once by VP James Costello, that I would be made aware of the changes they made in food handling protocol thanks to my reports. I have been home for more than 5 weeks and have not received any such report (which would not help my situation, other than to give me peace of mind that others who have food allergies now won't experience the unpleasant effects I had to endure). Anyone with food allergies knows how serious it is when they are breached. People could literally DIE and I was given no compensation for what I had to endure while in a medically supervised program. The bottom line is that my illness could have been 100% prevented had the staff been trained properly. There is simply zero excuse. I know this: Whether a restaurant has legal liability for harm caused by a food allergy depends on whether the restaurant was negligent. If the customer expresses concerns that go unaddressed or if the restaurant fails to take precautions for common allergies, they may be liable to a customer when harm results from a food allergy. They failed to take the proper precautions and served me every single one of my allergies, two of which I ingested and had reactions from.   I wrote emails on 2/2, 2/8, 2/9, 2/10,  2/19, 2/27 and 3/2.   I received a tone deaf reply from Jamie not acknowledging any allergen concerns I had on 2/13 stating that they ""looked forward to welcoming me back in the future!"" and another reply on 3/2 (after I forwarded my original email with photos) stating that ""I know Mike has been researching what happened and discussing your situation with the appropriate parties. He will get back to you once that is settled."" .....and then crickets. Mike never got back to me. I received a screenshot of their insurance company information and email on 3/15 after asking for it multiple times, but when I emailed the insurance company I found that no claim had been opened on my behalf (until today 3/20 when I got a reply). I was an award winning hotel manager for 30 years and it's Safety 101 to open a claim when someone is injured or is ill while on your property or under your care. I should not have had to remind them of that. This is all egregious behavior from a high-end facility that has such potential to change lives for good - not ruin their health in the process of someone like me attempting to better their health for the future. The setback I experienced while at Pritkin has me fearful once again to trust anyone outside my home with food preparation. Dr Blum, in a lecture on gut health, was absolutely floored when I told him I was served gluten. He literally stopped his lecture and shook his head and said he couldn't believe it and that it was very serious. He was the only one who showed me any empathy for what I went through!   If you have no food allergies, this place may be wonderful for you. The classes are amazing and the food - when you can eat it - is tasty after you get used to the lack of salt. Frank (biomechanics eval) and Lon (nutritionist I actually hired to help me after I got home) are rockstars.  But I simply cannot recommend a facility that mishandled my stay in this manner to anyone who has any dietary restrictions until they make assurances the staff is retrained. I cannot recommend a facility that does not honor a written price quote. My suggestions are to have each guest who has restrictions carry a card - in both English and Spanish - that is presented at every meal. Even though I did everything in my power, informing them in advance, asking at every meal, I still was exposed to my allergens. I was unable to enjoy my stay the same as every guest dealing with skin rashes, vomiting, eczema breakouts and the food fear at every meal that I was going to be served something that would make me ill. Do better, Pritkin - train your team properly, get them classes on food allergies, and have a dedicated person assigned to each guest with special restrictions so no mistakes happen -  then you will truly be a world-class facility.…",332,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d3263010-Reviews-Pritikin_Longevity_Center-Miami_Florida.html

Each room is very large, much like what you’d expect of a new high-end residential condo. But its real plus is its proximity to the Shops at Midtown Miami, which includes Target, Ross Dress for Less and Marshall’s.   There are two front desks, one for the hotel and one for the residences but they share a common lobby seating-lounge area. The hotel clearly considers itself an art hotel, considering the many works of art are in the lobby, the hallways and the guest rooms. All the front desk staff are exceptionally courteous and helpful.   The room-suite starts with the dining-kitchenette area that leads to the living room with sofa, arm chair, coffee table, and a large TV screen. The kitchenette has a coffee maker and a microwave. The dining table has two bar stools and is made in ultra-modern black-colored steel frames. A sliding door separates this area from the bedroom and T&B. The bed sits on a wooden platform some 6 inches from the floor – we guessed so you could put your feet on it before setting them completely down on the floor. There is a long minimalist desk in front of the bed with a large screen TV above it. We appreciated that the room had enough electrical outlets so none of our devices were left wanting for power.   It had a large T&B area, with a his and hers wash basin that we as a couple really appreciated. The fixtures were also in that consistent black color. The shower area was completely enclosed but it was all glass walls so it would probably be awkward if you were only friends.   We didn’t appreciate that at 3:30 in the early morning, the room intercom went blaring about an emergency and that everyone had to vacate and not use the elevators. What?! It was raining heavily outside but the hotel intercom just kept blaring that loud message. We kept deciding if we really should go down. Finally, after a few minutes, the broadcast stopped. My wife finally got through to the front desk and it turned out it was a false alarm. They apologized to her but they never bother letting anyone know by similar intercom broadcast that it was a false alarm and to stop getting ready to evacuate. What a bummer! My wife never got back to sleep after that.   There was no coffee shop where you could get breakfast but they did have a sushi bar for evenings.  …",255,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d15089284-Reviews-Hyde_Midtown_Miami-Miami_Florida.html

What a cool little hotel! We loved the retro design. The property is super clean and was exactly like pictured on line. The pool and pool bar is a great place to hang out and the adjoining greek restaurant & bakery was a life saver because we didn't have a rental car so walking to the somewhat local restaurants in 85+degrees sucked. Aside from a few restaurants there's really not all that much to do in the area and alot of the buildings were vacant or run down but Vagabond owners are trying to revitalize the area so in a few years I bet this will be a hotspot again. Was bummed they didn't have Bacardi/Rum or popular beers at the pool bar but we managed through. The only thing that really needs addressing is the room a/c. It's mounted in the weird open bathroom area; the bathroom was nice & cold but the cold air just can't make it out to the sleeping area so we literally had a cold zone and a warm zone.  (FYI only the toilet had a door in this particular room; the sink and shower area were open to the sleeping area with no door) There was a dehumidifier in the room but those generate heat so it was counter productive so we had to shut it off.  Very glad there was a ceiling fan and that I packed my personal size rechargeable fan cuz I wouldn't have been able to sleep in that heat without them!  All in all loved the hotel; if there was more to do in the immediate area on foot we'd come back but IMHO you really need a car.

Its entertainment and shopping district reflects the quirky-yet-sophisticated nature of its residents, and visitors can find everything from haute couture to haughty kitsch in the many shops at CocoWalk, steps from The Mutiny's front door. After all, where else can you see stars in broad daylight, dance through an island festival, and enjoy dinner at a funky cafe? Only at The Mutiny.",4.5,#25 of 155 hotels in Miami,We were very pleased with this choice for a 4-night stay in Miami. The location was excellent with the marina across the road and lots of restaurants nearby. Our one-bedroom suite seemed to have been recently renovated and everything was in perfect condition and all immaculate. The kitchenette was well equipped and we regretted not staying longer to take advantage of it. We knew in advance that we were going to be low down in the building but I would advise anyone booking to opt for a higher level as the view would be great. Again we knew in advance that there was no daily housekeeping and that was not a problem. Our only negative comment is that we were at the hotel over a busy weekend and there were a number of events and also the restaurant was closed for breakfast on a couple of days.…,1082,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d87137-Reviews-The_Mutiny_Hotel-Miami_Florida.html

I was experiencing a serious family emergency and needed somewhere to stay for at least one night, maybe two. The two ladies at check in were efficient, but failed to mention a restaurant/bar on property. Also no mention of pool, or any amenities for that matter.   The next morning, I realized I needed to stay another night. I was having to deal with my credit card fraud detection since I live in Kentucky and charges from Florida set it off. I kindly asked the woman at the front desk to give me my until 11:30 to get it sorted, then I'd come down to the desk with my card and get another night. She agreed. At 11:25, I had rectified the situation with my card and rang the front desk to let them know that I would be right down with the card for another night.   The incredibly rude woman proceeded to blatantly lie to me, ""we have no rooms for tonight."" I pointed out that the choice app, their website and every third party showed availability. I asked, ""what if I make it online."" She simply repeated they were full and a reservation by my would not be honored.   I'm baffled. I was there with my sister tending to a family emergency. We caused no trouble or disturbance.   The only possibility I can come up with is that, as an openly gay man, I was denied public accomodations. That goes against the constitution's commerce clause. It is federally illegal with extra protection in Miami.   I have never been treated with such malice and ignorance.

Both me and my partner found her to be incredibly rude and unprofessional during the 2 hours we stayed at the hotel. She showed no interest in providing good customer service and made me feel like I was bothering her when I voiced my concerns with the state of the hotel rooms.   The hotel itself was in poor condition as a result of her lack of management.  Our first room was infested with flies and mosquitos. To make matters worse, our room had missing curtains which made it impossible to sleep.  When I brought these issues to the attention of Jillian, she was unhelpful and dismissive, making it clear that she didn't care about the comfort or satisfaction of her guests and in fact suggested I was lying about the condition of the room.  We had to switch rooms multiple times during my stay, each time encountering new issues and having to deal with Jillian's unprofessional behavior. Once we finally convinced her to switch room, the shower in the second room flooded the bathroom making it impossible to use. Her annoyed response was to send a maid with a toilet plunger, which made absolutely zero progress unclogging the drain.   Jillian’s response to both me and the maid saying it was impossible to fix, was to ask us to leave and threaten me and my partner if we did not immediately leave.   Jillian’s complete lack of empathy and poor communication skills ruined our stay. I had high hopes for this hotel, but unfortunately, Jillian's poor management skills ruined the experience for me. I would not recommend staying here unless you enjoy being treated poorly in broken down, poorly managed and overpriced rooms. …",78,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d224243-Reviews-Courtyard_by_Marriott_Miami_Coconut_Grove-Miami_Florida.html

Overall, we really liked the apartments and the amenities at this property. We booked a Bay View one bedroom apartment and the view of the Freedom Tower and the harbor was STUNNING. Highly recommended you spring for the view if you can swing it.   Now for the quirks of the stay. I booked directly through Domio's website. On my first attempt, I found a promotion code as I was completing my booking and the website directed me to a different spot. I booked the stay, no confirmation e-mail, nothing. I called reservations, they could not find anything.  Second attempt, I booked my stay with the promo code and I received a confirmation e-mail. Then, the issues started. I got an e-mail that my credit card was not working to charge my stay. I called reservations back and the res agent attempted the charge again manually and it went through. Great. Problem solved. Not so fast.   Then, there is a $150 charge that the property holds for a security deposit. I start getting e-mails that the same credit card is not good. So I call reservations, they keep getting a decline on the card. So they send me a link to enter another credit card. I do so. This card is also declined. 3-4 calls to reservations later (including one from the property manager), the cards are still not working. I tell the property manager that I will speak to the staff when I arrive and they can try any of my 9 credit cards at that time. The manager tells me that the agent onsite cannot process a charge onsite. What?!?!? So I call reservations back. The agent looks through my charge attempts and says, ""Oh, one of these authorized two days ago."" Great. So I can check in? Yes, I can now check in.   So we check in. As I stated above, the apartment is great with a stunning view. No room service due to Covid-19, but that's fine.   The refrigerator in the room works, but the freezer and the ice maker are going crazy. Creating massive amounts of ice and making a lot of noise. You can't call someone directly at the property. All calls are routed through reservations. I sent an e-mail and then an hour or two later, the rep from the office comes down and takes a look. She apologizes and asks if she can send housekeeping by the next day to take a look. We say yes and agree on a 10 AM arrival. Housekeeping never shows and the fridge continues to generate enough ice for an igloo. Since the noise dissipated, we didn't press the matter any further.   Parking onsite is $25/daily. That seems like a lot, but it's downtown Miami. There's not going to be cheap parking anywhere nearby.   **NOTE** The locks for the apartments are also quirky. When you leave the room, you have to swipe your keyfob to lock the door. No one told us this, so we had been leaving our room unlocked for a couple of days. If you don't swipe your keyfob after you leave, your door isn't locked. When we discovered that, we were a bit surprised because no one from the staff let us know about this.   Overall, the property is great. There's a Whole Foods not far away and you're a block from the Metromover that will take you to may locations in downtown Miami for free (including a Publix supermarket in Brickell).  We really enjoyed the property, but the administrative mishaps got old. Hopefully, the staff can correct these issues moving forward.…",25,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d18807310-Reviews-Caoba-Miami_Florida.html

Aloft Miami - Brickell,hotels,"1001 SW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33130-4009","I had been here for a stay on a business trip just a few months back in March of 2023. This stay had convinced me actually that I wanted to stay again on a trip last weekend with my daughter on our annual daddy-daughter back to school shopping trip (July 2023), and I was disappointed.    In March when there on business there was a decent warm breakfast each morning that was well stocked for what it was.  There was nothing this past visit and the room that they set it up in was constantly half blocked off to even enter by a line control type barrier.  Also, on the previous trip the hotel advertises this happy hour of sorts in the lobby where there are some small bites and a little gathering that is shown based on the posters in the elevators to run from 4pm to 11pm I believe.  In March, it was a nice added touch. This trip it was non-existent despite the signs still being posted advertising it.  Also, despite no smoking signs throughout the floors, there was a very strong smell of marijuana in the elevators and at least the hallway of the floor we stayed on - 8th floor.   This all in addition to some hassles at check-in because of a reservation confusion that I had called about weeks ahead and was assured was not an issue, but was when I checked in.  Because of one good experience and a great location for this hotel, I am not saying I would not stay here again, but I will look into other places when I come to Miami again.…",4.0,#67 of 155 hotels in Miami,"The hotel is only one block away from the Metro station and the free people-mover station, which makes it very convenient to get around and to go to the airport.

There is a billiards table and bar in the lobby to hang out.  The breakfast was nothing to write home about.  Very basic food items and limited.  Fresh fruit was available, but only when I asked if there is anything.  Fruits and veggies are important when traveling.  ;)  My standard room was spacious and clean.

We we traveling with our children and meeting our in-laws in Florida to go on family vacation to Jamaica together.  We booked a double king room for one night at this hotel. We departed from Oklahoma and my in laws departed from Texas. Miami was the meeting place for our connecting flight to Jamaica the following day. Due to flight delays my in laws arrived ahead of us.  My father in law is a disabled veteran and has neuropathy. Walking long distances is very difficult and painful for him and hard surfaces like a bench for longer than 15-20 minutes causes him to hurt as well. They called the hotel to request a shuttle and after 30 minutes one never arrived. My father in law called my upset because he was hurting so I called and requested a shuttle and once again one never arrived. At this point they had waited over and hour.  I call once again and after another 30 minutes a shuttle never arrives. The hotel is less than 3 miles from the airport so it doesn't take long to get there. Frustrated by the situation they call a taxi which was only about $35. When I arrive that evening I go speak with the manager working the desk. She is the one I spoke with that was in charge of requesting the shuttle. I told her on the phone that my father in law was a disabled veteran and he couldn't sit long and she assured me they would be there in 20 minutes but as you already know they never arrived. When I questioned why the shuttle never showed up she became very defensive and telling me they did arrive and she has pictures to prove it. She claimed they arrived at the location and they were not there and she had photos to prove it. I thought that was an odd response but because it could be a honest misunderstanding I asked to see the photos and she got very upset and she refused to show me any proof of the misunderstanding. She accused us of lying about our location which upset me so I showed her my in laws life 360 report showing the exact location and time and this upset her even more. She became verbally aggressive with me when I asked to speak with the GM because I wanted to notify him of the situation and how she treated a disabled veteran. I asked her to refund the taxi at minimum and after an argument she agreed to reimburse the $35. I was never contacted by management of this hotel after requesting to be contact so I called customer service and they want to give me 5000 point for my trouble. In my opinion this hotel has no respect for people when something goes wrong and they sure do not respect veteran who have fought for their freedom. The whole situation should not have happened and they sure have dealt with it better. We never got as much as an apology.  So if you have a disability or you are a veteran who fought for this county BEWARE!!!!  They have no respect for you.  …,850,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d4451262-Reviews-Cambria_Hotel_Miami_Airport_Blue_Lagoon-Miami_Florida.html

No electrical outlets except for the one at 1 of the 2 night tables. 2. The bath robes looked fancy, but their fleece lining shed little black fuzz all over our body. 3. The breakfast selections in Restaurant 345 were so economical, even the FREE breakfast offerings at a typical Springhill Suites would be superior, with more choices of pastries and fresh fruits and pancakes/waffles. 4. Maintenance problems:  Over 5 nights, we stayed in 2 different suites: a. Suite 3826: The faucet of 1 of the 2 sinks sprayed straight out horizontally at us.  The first engineer ""fixed"" it by dramatically reduced the water pressure to a trickle.  The second engineer tried to fix it but somehow caused the electricity to shut off for both faucets and the TV.  We therefore had to move to the 2nd suite.  Another problem was that the lighting was very, very dimmed in the sitting room.  Only after having moved to the 2nd suite that we discovered that the lighting problem was caused by 3 sources:  the ceiling light was weak, the standing light and the table light were on dimmer but, because their switches were on long cords well-stuck under the furniture, we had not known that they could be controlled by us. b. Suite 4026:  The faucet of 1 of the 2 sinks only trickled water to such a degree that was unusable.  Afraid of another repeat of the electricity problem like the previous suite, we tried to avoid asking for a fix by using only the other sink.  After a couple days of that, we got fed up and decided to risk it by asking to have it fixed.  This time, a different engineer managed to increase the water pressure without causing any subsequent problems. c. Both suites:  The toilet got clogged often.  We suspect it was a common design problem because, whenever an engineer showed up, he was ready with a toilet plunger in hand!  Also, a common problem was the water pressure in the shower;  it was so weak that it always took a painfully long time for me to thoroughly rinse shampoo off my hair.…",390,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d2081138-Reviews-Hotel_Beaux_Arts_Autograph_Collection-Miami_Florida.html

The hotel is relatively new and well-kept. Lots of towels and all the amenities that are typical for a Springull Suites are all there to the brand standard. Parking was never a problem as the front gets full, but there was plenty of space in the back. The hotel smells good and the market is well stocked and has a nice variety of drinks and snacks.  Where the hotel falls short is in customer service. The front desk staff is rude and condescending, I felt like they really just don't care about anything. It's a shame, as this is a very nice hotel in a great part of Doral. But customer service and respect for people are basic staples of hospitality. One night I came back and my room had not been cleaned. I called the front desk and I was treated so poorly. The hotel still uses ""Covid"" as an excuse not to clean your room. You have to request it the day before by a certain time in the morning and be put on some obscure list. I was never told about this, allegedly it was on a small piece of paper inside my key card when I checked in.   Breakfast is awful. The manager told me it was to the Marriott brand standard. I disagree completely. Don't take it from me, take it from the many other reviewers who all talk about how limited the breakfast is at this hotel. After the second day, I never went again. Just not worth waking up for cold cereal.  Avoid rooms on the first floor at all costs. The housekeeping/laundry facility is there. The staff is extremely loud at all hours of the day with absolutely no regard for the guest rooms around them that might be trying to sleep, work, host a conference call, etc.  I did get to chat with the general manager while I was there. She was very nice and listened to my concerns. But it went nowhere. She did not do anything about it and that same evening it was more of the same with her staff. She promised a lot, but never really did anything for things to improve. I felt like she cared and was going to take my feedback to heart, but that was not the case at all. She walked away and nothing was done to change the experience. I never heard from her again.  I extended my stay becuase the day after thanksgivn ga realtivre had a stroke.

I showed the front desk pictures & video; long story short - we were finally moved to one of their updated rooms with the same view. Yes, the room is updated in all it’s modern decor, but it was quite dark and lacks Miami flavor. We found the outdated room to be much brighter and roomier. The double beds were also larger than the ones in the updated room. We have come to love Marriott beds but found these beds uncomfortable and did not sleep well at all during our four night stay. First for us staying at a Marriott - we’ve always raved of the comfy beds! The location was perfect for our needs and also appreciated the Publix market conveniently across the street. Suffice it to say, we may try another hotel next time we’re in town.…",721,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d120330-Reviews-Miami_Marriott_Dadeland-Miami_Florida.html

We’ve stayed at a JW Marriott in Tampa that was great and had great amenities and always had a place to eat open or at least get a snack. We spent over $400 for one nights stay. The hotel carpets needed a deep cleaning. For a Marriott Marquis, it was definitely not 5 star. There was a hard water film on the glass  shower wall, minimal toiletries, very rough towels and no washcloths provided. We came in late after a concert at 10:30pm. There was no where to get a snack except the minibar. The restaurant had closed 30 minutes early and the bar wasn’t offering food. The whole place just had a cold vibe. For downtown Miami and being a JW Marriott Marquis, it was subpar.  Also, the double beds were awful. There were thin feather toppers on the beds that had hard lumpy feathers with NO down obviously. There was also plenty of room for queen beds but a had to share a double bed. The room had a large office desk and chair. This is definitely a “convention center” type hotel and not meant for people wanting to relax. Even the coffee shop had short hours and no great coffee. Also, it would be nice if there was at least a vending machine. I know they want people to use the minibar but the offerings weren’t great. I will pick another location next time. For what we paid, it should have been much more clean and enjoyable. Oh, also, it was extremely humid in the room. I was born in Florida and there’s no excuse to keep an AC off when not in use. That just breeds mold. They even gave us an extra card to place inside the room so the air would turn off. Really?

Then I noticed immediately when I went into the bathroom there were no curtains in the bathroom which was up against another building with windows looking directly into the bathroom. I panicked and found the only items in the room that were big enough to cover the windows, which were two queen sized pillows (see photo). There were only 2 bath towels for a room that accommodates 4 people and no hand towels or face clothes. There were also no tissues in the room. I had to use toilet paper for things you would use tissues for, like make-up etc. There was a microwave and refrigerator (not defrosted in months), but no coffee pot or coffee which was a bit of a bummer. It also only had one small bar of soap which was gone after my first shower and I had to request (beg) for additional tiny bars of soap. This is definitely a 1 Star Motel. It is not worth the money unless you are attending Ultra Miami, which I was. It was the cheapest hotel I could find within 5 miles of the event. The first night I was there, which was a day before the event, there was an extremely loud party in the room next to me where it sounded like they were throwing furniture against the walls, literally.

We would definitely stay here again.",4.0,#2 of 3 campgrounds in Miami,"This is a huge 270 acre park adjacent to Zoo Miami. The park is named in honor of Larry Thompson who wrote a daily humor column, called ""Life With Larry Thompson,"" which ran in the Comics Section of The Miami Herald for more than two decades until his death on February 18, 1973. He also authored three books. In 1953 Thompson married aviator Gladys ""Penny"" Rhodes. He met Penny when he interviewed her for a story about women pilots and her involvement promoting international women's air races in South Florida. She was a pioneer in women's aviation in the 1940's and 50's and she is in the Florida Aviation Hall of Fame. She was the Florida chapter president of the Ninety-Nines, the women's pilot organization founded by Amelia Earhart who took off for her final flight from Hialeah. While Penny was a member of the Civil Air Patrol she flew over the Gulf of Mexico looking for German U Boats. On April Fool's Day in 1954, Penny gave birth to the couples twins, Carl and Evellen. For the twins first birthday, Penny invited all twins to come. More than 200 came and Life Magazine covered the party. Gladys ""Penny"" Thompson passed away on September 22, 1975 at the age of 57 in 1976.    After the couple passed away, their son Carl Thompson lobbied the Miami-Dade County Commission to name the park after his parents which they unanimously voted to do on November 17, 1975. The couple had a connection to parks because they loved to camp and Larry would chronicle their trips in his column. They both advocated for more parks and trees in Miami.  Larry and Penny Thompson Memorial Park and Zoo Miami are located on part of the former Richmond Naval Lighter Than Air Station which was a blimp air base used during WWII. Pilots from the base would patrol for German U boats off the coast of Florida. In 1945 a fire caused by a hurricane destroyed the hangers, blimps, 150 vehicles, and 366 planes including the one owned by Penny Thompson. If you go to the south entrance of the park you can still see the concrete arrow that used to guide the pilots landing at the base.  After the war the land was used by the University of Miami as a campus and research area for trees. In 1974 the United States government transferred the land to the county for the creation of the park. The next year it was named in honor of the Thompson's. In 1992 the park suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Andrew but has since recovered.  Today this is the largest campground/ park in Miami. The park contains a 22 acre lake with beach, picnic tables, playground, and bike, horse, and hiking trail. There are also three water slides that were not open when I visited. I am not sure if they are closed permanently. The 60 acre campground has 240 sites and a pool. During my visit there looked like a lot of construction was going on but it was open. The campground office has a historical display relating to Larry Thompson and his column. This large park has something for everyone. It is worth visiting if you find yourself in south Miami.…",83,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d897104-Reviews-Larry_and_Penny_Thompson_Memorial_Park_and_Campground-Miami_Florida.html

Los dias que lograron permanecer en este hospedaje, por las noches se escuchaban muchos impactos balísticos cerca de este lugar, a lo que se asustaron y temieron por la seguridad de su grupo familiar, frente a estos sucesos decidieron informar dicha situación a la anfitriona del lugar, en busca de una solución beneficiaria para ambas partes, y todo lo que recibimos por parte de ella fueron solo burlas e ironías… Lo que me pareció una falta de respeto total hacia nosotros sus huéspedes.  Fue tanto así, que una noche decidieron salir del lugar a altas horas de la madrugada con todo el grupo familiar, esta decisión fue motivada por miedo a su integridad física, ya que no se querían seguir exponiendo a sus pequeños a esta situación de riesgo que los estaba afectando en su estadía.  Por lo que decidieron pernoctar en otro lugar, cosa que no fue fácil encontrar, donde poder hospedarse, ya que por el horario y disponibilidad no encontraban lugar alguno,  tuvieron que dirigirse a varios establecimientos lo que les afecto directamente en gastos extras que no tenian presupuestados en sus planes, tanto de hospedaje como de transporte. Al día siguiente decidieron salir del lugar definitivamente, aun en espera de una respuesta de la anfitriona, respuesta mezquina hacia nuestros mensajes. Entendemos que lo que pueda ocurrir fuera del sector no es culpa de ella, pero el lugar no era como aparecía en las fotografias y en el entendido de ser turistas no teníamos el conocimiento de que ese sector no era el adecuado para un ambiente familiar. Lo único que esperábamos era una respuesta amable, educada y resolutiva por parte de la anfitriona, una solución que fuese equitativa para ambos, pero esto no ocurrió. Producto de todo lo mencionado anteriormente y los sucesos acontecidos, la estadía fue totalmente perjudicial en todo ámbito de cosas, es decir, económico, tiempo, emocional, etc. A lo que, como consecuencia de todo lo anterior no recomiendo este sitio, ya que el lugar no es adecuado para niños y no se encuentra un ambiente familiar con un espacio seguro.…",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d17677258-Reviews-Wynwood_Place-Miami_Florida.html

We had a snafu with our reservation (one King instead of the 2 Queens reserved).  It took a couple of hours to resolve, but it did get resolved and an upgraded room was provided which smoothed over that issue.    However, on the 2nd day I was there, I was at the pool and my friend and I stepped away from our lounge chairs for about 15 minutes to get a drink at the bar.  Yes, there was consistently a 15+ minute wait at the pool bar which was very frustrating.  A waiter would come around poolside about every 90 minutes, so we were forced to go order our own drinks.    While we were doing that, the clean-up crew came in and cleaned up our area.  Towels and personal effects including a pair of Airpod Pros.  I asked for assistance at the pool stand and was told very curtly in not so many words, nothing we can do.  I came back to the pool stand multiple times showing them the map which detailed where the airpods were located.  Again, we cannot help you.  That continued for 2 solid days and finally, at checkout, I once again pleaded with the front desk to assist me given that I had a live view of the location of the airpods.  ""We can't help you"" was once again the answer.  So I am out a pair of airpods and the Four Seasons will never again collect a dollar from me.  I would avoid this hotel in Miami.

Unfortunately, I was greeted with a moldy smelling room and blood stained counter covered with dead bugs.   With the present Covid 19 situation we are experiencing, I would not expect a Marriott establishment to drop the ball with cleanliness, something so critical at this day and time. I expressed my displeasure with the front desk manager in hopes that he would be accommodating and put us in another room or even offer housekeeping to come and do a more thorough sweep. Once again we were disappointed with the service as his only solution was for us to cancel the reservation and receive a refund.   In the business of hospitality, customer service should be a priority and it clearly wasn’t for the staff. Considering this is a marriott brand, it reflects poorly on all chains. If we had time to book another hotel we would have canceled our reservation without hesitation. The standards you have set for this hotel is subpar and disappointing.

Cabins at Oleta River State Park,campgrounds,"Oleta River State Park, Miami, FL 33160-4460",We stayed Mon-Thr just before Thanksgiving and had a great time. I will share some tips that I wish I had before going.  Plan on cleaning the cabins a little before settling in. There is some level of cleaning done but if you are a clean person you will probably want to do more. There are no brooms or anything in the cabins so bring your own if necessary.  They are strict about not letting you into the cabin much before 4:00 pm even if the cabin has been unoccupied for a week. They did let a member of our group check in at 3:15 and get access to the cabin which was a surprise. We had arrived a little after lunch and were told to come back at 4:00.  There is nowhere to set anything in the bathroom / shower area. There are a couple of hooks and that's it. There are no benches or anything. You have to be creative with your stuff. It's also tricky because you are likely trying to touch as little as possible during COVID times. Other then that the bathrooms are pretty clean and were never crowded when we visited.  Each cabin has both a grill and a fire pit which has a grill that can be moved in or out. I would recommend buying your firewood from the grocery store ($6/bundle). They sell wood in the park as well but it may be from fallen trees and seems to burn faster then the hardwood from the store (Publix). We enjoyed the grills and the fire pits.  There are lots of mosquitos and no see ums particularly at dusk and dawn. Bring spray.  There is a kayak put in very close to the cabins if you bring your own kayaks. We had a great time and found a variety of conditions. There is interior mangrove paddling that is very calm regardless of the winds. There are other areas that can be quite challenging in heavy winds. We had fun on our paddle.  There are a lot of mountain bike trails. The signs say they require helmets. There is also some casual bike riding in the park.  We had raccoons (we think) open up out cooler and take a lot of food. I would suggest bringing your cooler into the cabin or securing it well. We lost a lot of good food at night to the little bandits. There are stores within a couple of miles from the park if needed.   One of the days we did an excursion to Calle Ocho or Little Havana. We enjoyed it and the food was very reasonably priced. There is a  lot of Cuban Heritage to experience. We also visited Wynwood Walls which is a lot of nice murals in a somewhat sketch area. It's fine to drive around but everyone may not want to walk around there at night. It also seems like a decent size area to walk. You could probably walk a few miles to see all of the murals on multiple streets. South Beach is also close by and is an interesting place to experience.…,3.5,#3 of 3 campgrounds in Miami,"We spent two nights in one cabin at Oleta Park. The bed is pretty confortable and you have a grill and a table outside. AC is a perk too even if it’s noisy. Bathroom was clean. But the only big big flaw is that there is no fridge in the cabin and we unfortunately ran into roaches the second night because of the food kept inside the cabin (in a cooler and fruits in plastic bags on the table too). It was a big turn off for us. I think for the price we pay, which is not that cheap for a camping stay ($55 per night plus tax) a fridge would be of the best use. Apart from that, everything is nice, the beach is beautiful and water crystal blue and everything is kept pretty clean. So find a way to keep your food safe and you’ll have a good stay!

Def worth it.   ,4.0,#74 of 155 hotels in Miami,"This is a great place to stay if you are interested in checking out the local Wynwood scene. It's very walkable and the stay includes tickets to the Museum of Graffiti Art. The hotel is brand new, very hip, and has a rooftop pool and excellent food. We had drinks at Higher Ground, the indoor/outdoor bar on the 3rd floor. It was beautiful there, and the food was also excellent. We can recommend their crudite platter, the oysters, and the pork belly. We also really enjoyed chatting with the bartender. The downsides are that the rooms are on the small side, and while the hotel is very high tech, that means that things can go awry, especially as this is their first year of operation, and kinks are probably being worked out. Our first night none of the televisions on our floor were working (they moved us to a different floor on our second night). The second day the phones were not working. However, the staff are very personable and helpful, and I believe that by the end of their first year they'll have the tech sorted out.…",60,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d24889567-Reviews-Arlo_Wynwood_Miami-Miami_Florida.html

I will share some tips that I wish I had before going.  Plan on cleaning the cabins a little before settling in. There is some level of cleaning done but if you are a clean person you will probably want to do more. There are no brooms or anything in the cabins so bring your own if necessary.  They are strict about not letting you into the cabin much before 4:00 pm even if the cabin has been unoccupied for a week. They did let a member of our group check in at 3:15 and get access to the cabin which was a surprise. We had arrived a little after lunch and were told to come back at 4:00.  There is nowhere to set anything in the bathroom / shower area. There are a couple of hooks and that's it. There are no benches or anything. You have to be creative with your stuff. It's also tricky because you are likely trying to touch as little as possible during COVID times. Other then that the bathrooms are pretty clean and were never crowded when we visited.  Each cabin has both a grill and a fire pit which has a grill that can be moved in or out. I would recommend buying your firewood from the grocery store ($6/bundle). They sell wood in the park as well but it may be from fallen trees and seems to burn faster then the hardwood from the store (Publix). We enjoyed the grills and the fire pits.  There are lots of mosquitos and no see ums particularly at dusk and dawn. Bring spray.  There is a kayak put in very close to the cabins if you bring your own kayaks. We had a great time and found a variety of conditions. There is interior mangrove paddling that is very calm regardless of the winds. There are other areas that can be quite challenging in heavy winds. We had fun on our paddle.  There are a lot of mountain bike trails. The signs say they require helmets. There is also some casual bike riding in the park.  We had raccoons (we think) open up out cooler and take a lot of food. I would suggest bringing your cooler into the cabin or securing it well. We lost a lot of good food at night to the little bandits. There are stores within a couple of miles from the park if needed.   One of the days we did an excursion to Calle Ocho or Little Havana. We enjoyed it and the food was very reasonably priced. There is a  lot of Cuban Heritage to experience. We also visited Wynwood Walls which is a lot of nice murals in a somewhat sketch area. It's fine to drive around but everyone may not want to walk around there at night. It also seems like a decent size area to walk. You could probably walk a few miles to see all of the murals on multiple streets. South Beach is also close by and is an interesting place to experience.…,3.5,#3 of 3 campgrounds in Miami,We stayed Mon-Thr just before Thanksgiving and had a great time.

Shalimar is located in a nice few blocks. My wife and I walked to Starbucks in the morning each day. The neighborhood did not look bad at all during the day. I couldn't get a good read on it at night since we just came back and went to bed but compared to other parts of Miami it did not look too bad. The people at check inn was very kind. We received a ""gift bag"" of an activity guide and chips and cookies which was cute. It was also nice having free onsite parking. The room was pretty basic. Tile floors which I like because carpet floors can get nasty if places don't clean them. The bathroom was a little outdated but it was clean. Once again, I wasn't expecting the Ritz. The location is also great. We were able to take a cheap Uber to South Beach and other different areas in Miami.  Now for the drawbacks. The biggest issue was the walls in the room are super thin. I was hearing people in the rooms above me for most of the night and it was getting difficult to sleep. There was no phone in room thus calling down would be very difficult. The TV and cable was also very sub par. I don't go on vacation to watch TV but it was hard to find the news or watch some TV before bed at night. It also seemed like they were very tight when it came to pillows and towels because it was difficult to receive extra pillows and towels.  In summary, I would recommend this motel to people depending on the overall price. Like I said we were here Super Bowl weekend so the prices were inflated.

I realized that she asked me more amount than what i spent in this hotel. When i found her mistake, she just smiled. That's all. Pls check all bills of yours carefully and add up all by yourself.

First of all for the price you pay its amazing, there was no hidden fees, there was a washing machine, a kitchen with new appliance and marbles counters, tons of plates and dinnerware, parking pass, pool, a gym, and the views facing wynwood were breathaking, This location is really ideal because its close to the mia airport and the wynwood walls are close too, there is also a nearby a starbucks and pharmacy by biscayne boulevard. The apartment resembled a loft with PAX wardrobe,  soft towels, mikado products, new shower door, large round sink, colorful couches and pillows, a big glass table to dine on and another table in front of the tv where you can lounge, the studio apartments are very functional , spacious and tasteful. There was also a huge king bed which was really comfortable, clean and the comforters were a nice color and soft , i also enjoyed having a lot of large big pillows. I like the curtains by the balcony which were thick and you can roll them up or down to block all sunlight, then the big balcony had two big rocking chairs and again ill continue to brag about the amazing views of wynwood. I also like how i heard 0n noise when i shut my balcony doors, i slept so well! Everytime I needed something from the front desk they always answered the phone, and they allowed visitors [just give them heads up and they will allow them to sign in at front desk]. Shoutout to zenia for being such a doll, when i had a snafu with my luggage at the airport she was so accomodating with a huge smile on her face, they can always hold or accept luggage at the front desk if you claim it with a form, and she answered all my questions from wifi to parking. This hotel is also flexible with pets and late checkout , for checkin they dont let you do early since the apartment isnt ready until 3. I also loved the art in the lobby and colorful neat furniture, it really was an accurate representation of wynwood style. I also enjoyed how this hotel is near the wynwood marketplace and jimmyz [amazing mofongo on the same block], so you will always find really good food and drinks and entertainment. What holds me back from giving this place 5 stars is the pool on the 5th floor,  the views are amazing and the pool was big and clean but there was not enough tables and furniture, they would really benefit from creating cabanas and maybe having some floats, it would be great for aesthetic and comfort I do like that there was long hours at pool and security was really nice. The lock on the door was actually confusing to figure out, you have to turn the key and push at the same time. I also wish they gave equipment for the beach[i was able to go to beach on ocean drive which was 20 mins away], some hotels do include that but since you dont pay a resort fee here you wont get that access or amenity.

The reception area was an absolute mess and the room keys were actual keys and not cards like typical hotels. The pictures of the rooms are close up for a reason. They don't want you to see what the room looks like as a whole. The bed was barely a mattress, every channel on tv was fuzzy, and the main issue was the only air in the room was a small window unit. The hotel should be $50 a night and no where near $175-$200 a night. Absolute rip off. We ended up checking out early and went to another hotel. The receptionist didn't bother to ask why we were leaving and just said, ""Ok."" I'm guessing she has heard this before.

I’ve been a Marriott Platinum member for a number of years and recently dropped to Gold status so I’ve stayed at a lot of Marriott properties. This may be in contention for the worst ever.  Let’s start at check-in. Corporate booked my stay with the AAA rate. I explained the card I had on me was expired but I had the email I had showed a temporary card that had been renewed (I just hadn’t received it). Took a while to get this sorted with the front desk. It’s weird since they ask for all the AAA info when you book so you would think they can verify it with their system. Other Marriott properties have told me they can do this and don’t ask for the card.  Next issue, they tag on a $17 a little extra resort fee. They claim with it you can get a free drink and the restaurant (except I don’t drink alcohol) and enhanced internet (which I don’t need). I didn’t see a way to opt out and for business travel this doesn’t work. I can’t have hidden fess. Also, this hotel is the furthest thing from a resort so it’s an absurd charge.  Getting into the room, the issues continued. The room wasn’t particularly clean and my room was next to an insanely loud highway with what sounded like metal spikes. It was impossible to fall asleep as it sounded like I was sleeping in the middle of a busy highway. On top of that there was periodic drilling.   Unfortunately, those weren’t the only issues. I’m thankful it was only a one night stay and I’ll be avoiding this hotel at all costs for the rest of my life. …",822,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d1584732-Reviews-SpringHill_Suites_by_Marriott_Miami_Downtown_Medical_Center-Miami_Florida.html

I booked my two one-night stays based on TripAdvisor reviews and it was a huge mistake.  1. It is one of the farthest of the airport hotels. If you search it, it looks like the closest, but it's actually on the other side of the airport, and a $20-25 cab ride (with a tip).  2. I took cabs because the free shuttle is terrible. On my outbound to Europe stay (crashed in Miami to break-up the trip from LA), I arrived at almost midnight. My flight had been delayed and I was tired...I called the hotel to let them know I was waiting for a shuttle and at which baggage claim (as instructed), 15 minutes later I called again and they said it was on its way. At 30 minutes I just took a cab and paid the fare...only to find the shuttle sitting out in front of the hotel with the driver sleeping...Also, with the hotel being so far away, even if it is going back and forth, you're gonna probably wait a long time in that awful Miami heat and humidity (next to all the fumes).  3. The hotel itself is basic, bland, and really, really worn around the edges. They have disengaged teenagers manning the front desk (both times). It's not even really a hotel, more like a cheap motel. I don't often feel the need to check for bed bugs, but I did here. Thankfully, none that I know of. Felt like there were quite a few long-time motel ""residents"" living there, too. Not usually a good sign.  4. Don't expect food or drink to be options, much less a robe or slippers. Obviously no room service and you'd have to walk a bit to buy anything outside of the place. They have a little shelf in the lobby with chips, cup-o-noodles and bottled water/a few sodas, and it's gonna cost you. The breakfast they provide in the lobby barely passes for food.  Anyway, this should be your last choice of airport crash pads. You can do much better - on the drive from baggage claim to this place I saw quite a few much nicer places that were the same price (I checked).  Don't trust the ratings here or the enhanced photos.…",1554,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d3782458-Reviews-Best_Western_Plus_Miami_Airport_North_Hotel_Suites-Miami_Florida.html

I have stayed at many many hotels over the years, and never filed a negative review or a complaint.  So, here is my one and only online bad review.  My wife and I booked multi-day pre-cruise and post-cruise stays at the Marriott Dadeland.  For at least 20 years, the Marriott Dadeland has been our hotel of choice. Not anymore. They gave us a room on the 21st floor.  Sounds pretty good, right? Actually, not so much.  In fact, not at all.  Our current pre-cruise stay has been horrible, to say the least.  There was a constant hum and vibration in the room due to the roof-top air conditioner just a few floors above us. We were told that hotel staff and management knew about this problem for years but did nothing about it.  They charged the same room rate for habitable rooms as the uninhabitable rooms.  I guess they just hope you put up with it and don’t complain. As I write this review, it is 3:00 AM and have spent a very sleepless night.  Hotel gave us a room on a much lower floor.  Due to this disruption, I asked if they would consider a price adjustment.  They offered to deduct $30 from the bill (about $260 per night; not cheap) and give us two bottles of water.  Not exactly generous, especially for a long-time and so-called “Bon Voy” preferred customer.  We had hoped to get a good nights sleep before we check out this morning to leave on our cruise. No such luck. I should also mention that when we arrived at the Marriott Dadeland this morning, there was a notice at the front desk that the pool was closed and not available during our stay.  In addition, they sent an email warning guests that there would be indoor construction during the day and to expect noise in the room, but, as I recall, Marriott didn’t send the construction noise email until after the deadline had expired to cancel the reservation without being charged a penalty fee equal to the cost of one night’s stay.    It is now clear to me that it is the policy and practice of this hotel to 1) book rooms, knowing that they are partially uninhabitable without any prior warning to the guest yet still charge full price, and 2) trap guests into into staying at the hotel, while it is under construction, without timely informing them about the construction noise until after the time to cancel without a penalty has expired. In my opinion, these are nothing less than deceptive business practices.  It certainly tells you an awful lot about how Marriott now chooses to conduct business and insult and disrespect its guests.    I believe that customers should express displeasure and, when their problem is not resolved to their satisfaction, “vote with their feet” and take their business elsewhere.  As such, here I am, at three in the morning, in the process of canceling our post-cruise three day reservation at the Marriott Dadeland, and instead arranging to take my business elsewhere and stay at a non-Marriott hotel — probably the nearby Hilton Hotel, where we once stayed because rooms at the Marriott Dadeland were not available.…",721,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d120330-Reviews-Miami_Marriott_Dadeland-Miami_Florida.html

This is an unsafe location.  I am a long term hotel resident and the 100 percent compliance they say they provide is simply NOT TRUE. I have documented proof of ongoing safety violations. These violations are daily and especially on weekends when they offer “Staycations” to  local residents.

They never mentioned what time or where breakfast was. We got up to our room and it looked new and clean. When we tried to look out the window at our Lagoon view, we couldn’t get the window shade up. Upon trying to adjust the a/c the windowsill just flipped off from the window when you put your hand on it. Underneath that there are ants crawling. We then went to kitchenette area to get ice bucket and there were remnants of pop tart wrapper behind coffee maker. We were so exhausted so went to take a shower and they have these big bottles of shampoo and condition affixed to the wall inside the shower. Well, after getting in and soaked I try to get a couple pumps out of shampoo but nothing. I tried a good 12-15 pumps but still nothing, same for conditioner bottle. The beds were clean and comfortable. We luckily didn’t have our entire family with us as the “curtain” to separate the beds from the sleeper sofa was missing. Next morning we were ready for breakfast but since we didn’t know it was we went to front desk. As we must have had a confused look on our faces the two younger staff blurred out “it’s on the 10th floor” and mind you there was no mention on the hotel app or at check in. We turned around and went back in elevator to go up to 10th floor. We got up there and there was somewhat of a buffet. A staff member offered to get batter as I was standing there waiting for some to slowly come out of waffle container. She came back promptly and then said she would help and pour it in, I thanked her. I then was helping my family to get their food and they were completely out of milk as well as many items. When it was time to get myself and husband drinks the juice machine wasn’t working so I asked the same staff member about how to use it. She then said breakfast was over at 9am. We got up to breakfast area at a few minutes after 9am but no one, not even the front desk staff that told us to go to 10th floor mentioned the times. So at this point we ate what we could and then cleaned up and left. We decided to find out where the pool was as it didn’t show it on hotel app floor plan. We go back to the front desk and ask where the pool is located. They pointed to down a hall then outside next to hotel. We go out there to take a look since our daughter was interested in swimming. Well, there’s paper signs on the gate and a red sign on pool rules saying “pool is temporarily closed”. We go back inside and to the front desk to tell them it’s closed, they look puzzled and say they had no idea. Problem though is those signs are faded and must have been there a few days. Needless to say we did not have anywhere near the experience expected by a Hilton family brand. We tried this property because it looked nice and new…next time we will stick with the Hilton down the road.…",12,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d23650200-Reviews-Home2_Suites_By_Hilton_Miami_Airport_South_Blue_Lagoon-Miami_Florida.html

Element Miami International Airport,hotels,"3525 NW 25th Street, Miami, FL 33142-7698","Due to missing a flight connection we were directed via Voucher to this hotel. The accommodations were amazing, check in simple, food court was great…. But the best was our shuttle driver named Emilio.  He picked us up at the airport and truly made our awful airport experience into a positive one. He was happy, friendly, informative and prompt.  He also picked us up the next morning. Excellent Customer Service and a true representative of the Marriott / Element company…..",4.0,#55 of 155 hotels in Miami,"I'm leaving this review two months after my stay. I communicated the below to the hotel, first at the front desk where the clerk just shrugged and said that's too bad. Then via Marriott Bonvoy by email, where I was assured the hotel management team would follow up with me.   I never heard from anyone again, and assume I won't at this point.  Food and beverage in the new restaurant at this property was atrocious and I feel ripped off. I’ve been to this hotel 3-4 times on stopovers and this will be the last.  The server spent the entire meal chatting with guys at the bar while those of us seated at tables didn’t get even the basics.  I ordered a glass of wine, a Caesar salad, and wings. The wings came out within a minute of my ordering, and anyone who’s ever worked in a restaurant knows what that means — they were reheated from a previous order. Sure enough, they were dry and tough as nails, and came with plastic cutlery.  She finally got around to bringing my first drink halfway through my finishing the wings.  I waited with an empty plate for a while until I flagged down the server and asked her, is my Caesar salad still coming? She shrugged and said, “I’d assume so, wouldn’t you?” And walked away. Completely rude.  The salad came half an hour after the wings. Not mixed, no bacon bits… just chopped romaine and some croutons on a plate with a plastic ramekin of Caesar dressing for $12.  I would have sat and drank another glass of wine had the server ever come back, but she did not. I had to flag her down and ask for my bill, after sitting there being ignored for far too long alongside other diners with dirty plates and empty drinks. One couple asked for their drinks twice, and I saw him finally go up and ask her for them at the bar.  When I got the bill, there’s an 18% auto gratuity! I can see an auto-grat for a large group, but no wonder she didn’t care about providing service when she’s guaranteed an 18% tip for doing nothing.  The icing on the cake is that they only have a wired debit machine, so she yelled across the room that she needed my PIN and I had to maneuver around another woman trying to pay and lean over the counter in my skirt to key in the PIN.  Completely unacceptable for the Marriott brand from start to finish. I spent over $50 USD for some lettuce on a plate, reheated wings, plastic cutlery and paper plates, one drink, and a bad attitude from the server. Never again.…",1904,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d2153356-Reviews-Element_Miami_International_Airport-Miami_Florida.html

Sorry but at this point I’m not sure I want to sit down at this hotel.  They had a room at the hotel next door but it was not a suite as I reserved and paid for. At this point I asked for a refund so I can go elsewhere but guess what, she can’t do that, only the manager can which she couldn’t get in touch with. I requested that they move me to a sister property which I have stayed at and never had issues with but she said she couldn’t do that either without the manager which she can’t get in touch with!!!!. It shouldn’t be hard to refund my Marriott points so I can stay at a hotel without bugs.  What really pissed me off is that they think this is a laughing matter. I could hear the girl at the desk along with the girl at the courtyard next door she was on the line with laughing about the situation. Not that funny when you have BED BUGS in your room!!!!

In the heart of this tropical paradise sits The Mutiny Hotel, a luxurious all-suite property neighboring the pristine waters of Biscayne Bay. A bright swatch of coral set against the intensely blue South Florida sky, the Mutiny's 12-story tower epitomizes the South Florida style; vibrant colors compliment chic accommodations elegantly decorated in a modern-lavish motif. Long a playground for the elite, The Grove - as it is known by locals - is also a second home to many celebrities, artists, and jetsetters. Its entertainment and shopping district reflects the quirky-yet-sophisticated nature of its residents, and visitors can find everything from haute couture to haughty kitsch in the many shops at CocoWalk, steps from The Mutiny's front door.

We called back to the front desk at 6PM, 7PM and 7:30PM and each time were told that they were on their way up with the pack and plays. At this point we were approaching bedtime for the 8 month and 17 month old. At 7:45PM I went down to the lobby to pick up food we ordered and stopped by the front desk. The gentleman and the front desk told me that he had just talked to the guy who was bringing them and up and he was on his way right at that moment. I said no worries, there are other people in the rooms to receive the pack and plays. I waited in the lobby for 15-20 minutes for our food to arrive. Once it did I called the other guests in the room to see if the pack and plays had arrived, they had not. I went back to the front desk and the gentleman didn't have any answer except that he was on his was right then. Eventually one pack and play showed up around 8:15PM and they said they were still looking for the second. One baby was put down while we waiting for the second to come, at this point over three hours since we had checked in and they initially told us they were bringing them up. We called back down again around 9PM to inquire about the second pack and play and they said they didn't have another. The communication was exceptionally POOR.

Magic City Farm,ranch,"281 NE 84th St, Miami, FL 33138-3918","First, let me sum up my review for the busy readers: This is an interesting option, but it is not a hotel and it is certainly not for everybody. That said, it can be quite charming...if you are in the mood for a very laid-back, down and dirty trip to Miami. The rooms are a series of unattached bungalows. These are about 20 years older than the city itself (founded around 1899). When I stayed, it was cold (between 70-50 F) and the walls afforded little warmth. However, they are not designed for sub070 temperatures and you are not likely to encounter them anyway. The rooms are decorated in a very sweet way. No little sculpture or scarf-as-window-tie seems to have been an afterthought. There are odd cabinets and shelves all over as well, which lends it a certain quaint charm. This is a farm, though, so water use is limited and the showers are not the best. Perhaps that is because there's an outdoor shower for guest use. There is also a main bungalow where you can keep coffee and milk in a communal refrigerator. The common bungalow is also pleasant, has a warm and inviting living room area and is a nice place to chat with other guests if you are so inclined.  This is a farm and it is situated in an area near Little Haiti that is not altogether wholesome. But it is a farm...meaning there are thousands of plant species burgeoning at every corner. There's a pig. There are ducks and chickens and an entire *gang* of very friendly dogs who wander in the wake of owner Tamara as she tends to various tasks around the premises. Tamara is very friendly, always up for a chat--long or short.   Now, the fact that it is a farm does make the setting kind of alternative and enchanting. However, if you are planning to enjoy the nightlife and have a series of urban events planned, this is not the place to be. It's a FARM! That means that although it is beautiful, there is plenty of dirt, animal run-ins etc. I suppose it is self-selecting. I enjoyed my stay--had I been there for fun rather than for business, I might have had a great time. As it was, it was despite being a farm that I enjoyed my stay.…",4.5,#1 of 1 ranch in Miami,"First, let me sum up my review for the busy readers: This is an interesting option, but it is not a hotel and it is certainly not for everybody.

Unfortunately the price and location weren't worth it, as soon as we arrived there was a couple arguing that their room wasn't clean and that they wanted it changed immediately, this dispute room about 30-45 minutes until we were able to check in because there was only one Concierge on duty (as there always was during the trip).   The hallway to the elevators always smelled horrible and the hotel seemed like it hadn't been cleaned in a week. Our room wasn't clean, the bathroom wasn't either and the carpet seemed like it hadn't been vacuumed in a VERY VERY long time, none of us dared to put our feet on the ground without any shoes. The room first smelled like someone was trying to hide a smell with a lot of perfume and the second day we returned we knew it was because the hallway smelled like weed (we were on the second floor next to the elevator). We asked for 4 towels beforehand in the Marriot Bonvoy App but the Concierge told us that they were fully booked and that there were no available towels they could give us, so we had to reuse one for the first night.   We were told to put the trash on the hallway because they weren't going to clean out rooms (we didn't mind that because of COVID). We had a two beds in our rooms, both of the sheets were stained, with God knows what, and because it was too late into the night when we saw it we were told that housekeeping had already left and that they weren't going to change them.   On our second day we talked to the NICEST Concierge about our towel situation, he said that they still had no towels to give us but he came back with three towels from the gym and a couple of hand towels to try to make up for it. He was actually the ONLY employee that was trying to help us during our whole stay, he did everything possible to help us or any guests if we had any troubles which we really appreciated the effort.  There was a boarding pass station on the lobby and when we went down to print our boarding passes there wasn't anyone around in the lobby to help us figure out how to print our boarding passes and our COVID tests, we had to have someone form our room call the main desk in order for someone to show up to help us and even then the answer was ""I can't help you"" (mind you it was 11 pm and we were already very frustrated), another guest tried helping us but we were unsuccessful to use that station but we were able to use the business center to print them.  If I could say anything to anyone who wants to stay at this hotel is DON'T, we were hoping to save $200 between this and a couple other hotels but I am telling you IT ISN'T WORTH IT. The stress of the dirty room, the towels, the staff that wasn't helpful, the broken boarding pass station. It's not worth it, our expectations were low but this hotel and it's service really were very below par, don't waste your money and time go someplace else.…",336,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d1390847-Reviews-Courtyard_Miami_West_FL_Turnpike-Miami_Florida.html

UNHYGIENIC. RUDE. NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURES!!! Read this review before booking. I know it’s long but I guarantee worth it  When I arrived to Miami the other day, I was highly disappointed. The hotel looked nothing like the pictures. The only pool view was across the street at the neighboring hotels pool. The elevator was ridiculously small maybe 4 guest can fit assuming they don’t have any suitcases/bags. To my surprise the worst part still had to come – the “good night of sleep” I was so looking forward to  evolved into the worlds worst nightmare. Before even getting into the room there were several red flags. I should have known they would be lacking in quality when the sign behind the front desk at the right hand side said “Hotel YVE MIAM” that’s right miam. No “i” just Miam. They charge a “resort fee” for 2 waters Wi-Fi use and two free drinks…. The drinks are pre-picked and rail/house liquor.  Honestly absolutely disgusting. Don’t waste your time use the drink ticket to get a soda or juice the alcohol is horrible. After you leave the crappy bar go up to your room. Inside of mine   the stopper on the tub didn’t work. It was an instant foot bath…. Disgusting. Towels were provided but no washcloths were in the room. So essentially they provide you with enough to dry off your body but no tool to clean it. I think they forgot the washcloths because they want your body to be as dirty as the facility. Over the time of being in this room I have seen not one but THREE roaches in my room!!!! The first photo was the first time my stomach churning friend appeared. I screamed very loud and immediately alerted the front desk they said they would take care of the issue. I know roaches are dirty and lay eggs so I didn’t want to chance it coming home with me or anything. Silly me for believing they would handle it. They didn’t cover the hole in the bathroom or spray or anything. I wouldn’t have known this since when I returned to my room the bed was made and all the towels folded. They just did a turn down service.  I only know this  because The next day I wake up with just enough time to stop A ROACH from crawling into my personal belongings. Ewwwww that’s the second photo of yet another roach this time in my main room area. At this point I’m so upset my blood is boiling I instantly panic and frantically pack all my things. As I’m packing ANOTHER ROACH crawls out of the closet. (Picture 3)  That was my last straw I left for the airport instantly.  And also the food sucks!!!! The breakfast buffet is $25 per person plus gratuity and an additional resort fee. For two buffet meals it’s $65 and they don’t fret juice you only get one small glass of orange juice with the “buffet” the pita was hard!! The bagels are not fresh. The cereal only has two options. The bacon was burnt. The eggs were powdered eggs. 0/10 review.

Two of us stayed for 14 days during the. month of February 2021. We stayed in one bedroom suite on the third floor of the south building. We stayed on a revenue reservation (paid for, not with points). The room that we stayed at was smoked in, L shaped sofa had urine stains and cigarette burn marks, living room carpet had a throw up stain. Neighboring rooms were occupied with people who were smoking inside and outside their room. The room quality complaint was brought up to the reception with the request for rectification, however in 14 days of our stay management was so busy ""in meetings""  that they were unable to return our call or offer an apology or an alternative room. Receptionist solution was you are welcome to check-out and look for another property to stay at which put us at disadvantage as only rack rates were available at neighboring properties. When asked if status with Marriott makes any difference, they said no. They also said no to upgrade where on the website the upgrade was available.  And to add insult to an injury, expensive personal property was stolen from the car parked on ""secure"" parking lot at 3pm during daylight.  This property and it's management is an embarrassment to Marriott brand and values. Do not expect to be a valued customer.

Cabins at Oleta River State Park,campgrounds,"Oleta River State Park, Miami, FL 33160-4460",We stayed Mon-Thr just before Thanksgiving and had a great time. I will share some tips that I wish I had before going.  Plan on cleaning the cabins a little before settling in. There is some level of cleaning done but if you are a clean person you will probably want to do more. There are no brooms or anything in the cabins so bring your own if necessary.  They are strict about not letting you into the cabin much before 4:00 pm even if the cabin has been unoccupied for a week. They did let a member of our group check in at 3:15 and get access to the cabin which was a surprise. We had arrived a little after lunch and were told to come back at 4:00.  There is nowhere to set anything in the bathroom / shower area. There are a couple of hooks and that's it. There are no benches or anything. You have to be creative with your stuff. It's also tricky because you are likely trying to touch as little as possible during COVID times. Other then that the bathrooms are pretty clean and were never crowded when we visited.  Each cabin has both a grill and a fire pit which has a grill that can be moved in or out. I would recommend buying your firewood from the grocery store ($6/bundle). They sell wood in the park as well but it may be from fallen trees and seems to burn faster then the hardwood from the store (Publix). We enjoyed the grills and the fire pits.  There are lots of mosquitos and no see ums particularly at dusk and dawn. Bring spray.  There is a kayak put in very close to the cabins if you bring your own kayaks. We had a great time and found a variety of conditions. There is interior mangrove paddling that is very calm regardless of the winds. There are other areas that can be quite challenging in heavy winds. We had fun on our paddle.  There are a lot of mountain bike trails. The signs say they require helmets. There is also some casual bike riding in the park.  We had raccoons (we think) open up out cooler and take a lot of food. I would suggest bringing your cooler into the cabin or securing it well. We lost a lot of good food at night to the little bandits. There are stores within a couple of miles from the park if needed.   One of the days we did an excursion to Calle Ocho or Little Havana. We enjoyed it and the food was very reasonably priced. There is a  lot of Cuban Heritage to experience. We also visited Wynwood Walls which is a lot of nice murals in a somewhat sketch area. It's fine to drive around but everyone may not want to walk around there at night. It also seems like a decent size area to walk. You could probably walk a few miles to see all of the murals on multiple streets. South Beach is also close by and is an interesting place to experience.…,3.5,#3 of 3 campgrounds in Miami,"The park itself was wonderful, its a great hideout from living in the city. The park offers kayaking and many activities. When the night fell the barn fire was great and making s'mores was wonderful UNTIL... entering the cabin. Many little bugson the floor, the door had openings everywhere and the A/C was EXTREMELY loud. before sleeping, I took precautions to prevent any bed bugs/ tics or fleas and sprayed our bed with special chemical to kill any existing. I woke up the next morning with Multiple bites across my stomach and  legs. They itched horribly, my legs looked diseased. we only stayed for a night and it took 2 weeks for the itching and swelling to subside. I love the outdoors  but this wasn't what I would expect when renting a cabin.",15,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d3717779-Reviews-Cabins_at_Oleta_River_State_Park-Miami_Florida.html

The problem is the Shuttle service they have from the hotel to the Port of Miami.  The shuttle driver did not secure the luggage carrier latch and as a result all of our luggage fell out onto the road as he was driving (at a high speed).  All of the luggage was badly damaged with road rash and dents from the fall onto the road and 3 pieces of luggage that fell out were stolen by people passing by.  When we realized what had happened and told the driver our luggage had fallen out of the shuttle, he did go back to retrieve the luggage but the damage had been done.  Since some of the people's luggage were stolen which meant they didn't have luggage for their cruise, and they were extremely upset.  The Miami Dade police were called and tried to deal with the stolen luggage while we waited in the shuttle.  The shuttle driver was unapologetic.  The shuttle driver did not even offer to return the fair for those whose luggage was stolen.  Upon return home from our trip, we contacted the hotel who gave us the number for the shuttle company.  The shuttle company has been unprofessional, unapologetic and accusatory.  The shuttle driver is not telling the truth and indicated only a couple of pieces of luggage fell out of the carrier.  After further discussion, the shuttle driver admitted more luggage fell out but then indicated there was no damage.  This is ridiculous.  We have pictures to show the road rash and damage that is all consistent with the bags falling out of the carrier at high speed and rolling around on the road.  In the end, the shuttle company said they are not willing to do anything for us.  No compensation at all.  All of our luggage was in very good shape prior to this incident.  Two pieces of luggage were brand new.  All of our luggage is now badly damaged.   Since the shuttle company is negligent and irresponsible and obviously is not properly covered by insurance and is unfamiliar with how to deal with customers respectfully, the Holiday Inn Express Miami Airport East should discontinue their partnership with this very unsatisfactory shuttle company and since the shuttle company is not being responsible for the damage caused, I think the Hotel should take some responsibility in this case and provide compensation for our damaged luggage.  Warning!!  Do not use the shuttle service from this hotel.  …",404,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d6778393-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Express_Suites_Miami_Airport_East_an_IHG_Hotel-Miami_Florida.html

I called guest services and requested a skillet. They said they couldn’t guarantee what was available. Eventually someone brought me two different sized pots. I explained I needed a skillet or flat pan to make a grilled cheese or like something to fry an egg for breakfast. I thought the person understood my request but he didn’t come back. Instead, I decided I might have better luck and placed an order for a cheap one from Instacart from Big Lots. I also had to order a spatula.   Next, this is gross.

SoBE Design Studio,condos,"420 15th St South Beach, Miami, FL 33139-7950","My firends and I booked a room for two nights in order to celebrate a birthday among us. The woman at the counter booked one night, so she gave us a second night in a completely different room. In the first one, the shower wasn't working, so we had to bathe in the sink. In the second room, OUR SHOWER WAS LEAKING TO THE OTHER 3 FLOORS BELOW US, so we had to use the bathroom in the room next door- which was completely dirty. The let us check out two hours later than usual with no charge, but checking out took about HALF AND HOUR, and the valet wanted to charge us way more than necessary.   While the views were gorgeous and I love Miami, it doesn't compensate for the bugs in the cabinets and lobby cushions, nor the awful attitudes of their staff. When we went down to complain, they started speaking in Spanish about us, thinking we couldn't understand them (we're all south american) and whoever seemed to be in charge could have been more difficult to cooperate with. She told us that they weren't going to change us from the second (leaky) room because housekeeping had gone home and every other room was booked or dirty.  On top of it all, it takes about half an hour tfor valet to get your car, and if you're checking in/out, add another 45 minutes.  RENT SOMEWHERE ELSE!!! Don't let them sucker you out of your money.

I went to the front desk and confronted him directly. Not only did he refused to call his manger he got belligerent, swore at me (which I returned the gesture) then he called the police.

The officer was confused about why he was there but after I explained he asked me if I wanted to press charges against Oscar. The corporate office even tried to call Oscar and he refused to talk to them. He also refused to give me the mangers number again. Per corporate request I've taken a picture of Oscar flipping me off in front of my kids and mother- in- law.

There is a rooftop pool overlooking the bay and sailboats. Right outside of the hotel doors is a beautiful park, and next to that is all of the restaurants and shopping in the coconutgrove community.  It’s a nice and safe area, very different from the hustle and bustle of Miami. Everything is in walking distance. Maybe a 15 min drive into the big city.",4.5,#2 of 4 special hotels in Miami,"The rooms at iCoconut Grove are beautiful.  Our room had wraparound glass, floor to ceiling walls on two sides overlooking the bay.  It had a kitchenette, refrigerator and dishwasher all in great shape.  Also a washer/dryer in the bathroom.  The double pain glass blocked out most outside noise making the room extremely quiet.  My only recommendation on the room would be softer pillows and a less squishy mattress.  I woke up with an ear ache from the pillows.  I believe the description or follow up communication could be much clearer.  The fact that the iCoconut Grove is actually a management group who own the room that is within the hotel was not clear.  I guess they call them owner occupied rooms that they rent out.  This info was missing on Hotels.com booking site, and was not made clear at all once I booked to room.  It seemed almost cryptic.  Maybe the iCoconut Grove team thought this would be confusing for folks to understand, but it would have made it easier in trying to navigate to the hotel.    Additionally, any questions or issues you may have about the room needs to be directed to the ownership team.  I had trouble getting hot water the first morning, and when I asked them to send an engineer up to check on it while we were out for the day, I was told they could not go into the room without me being there because it was an owner rented room.    Lastly the description on Hotels.com site claimed there was a $30 food/Beveridge allowance on a credit type card available for each stay.  This turned out to be only $10.  Redeemable at a restaurant the iCoconut Grove company owns a few blocks away.  The restaurant was very good.  The restaurant in the hotel itself was closed and/or undergoing extensive renovations.  Hard to tell.    There was also a promised complimentary bottle of champagne.  Which was actual French Champagne and was very good.   Not having direct accountability with the hotel vs the ownership group was a new experience for me.  But once we were settled in we had a lovely stay.  The town of Coconut Grove is lovely and extremely walkable.

When they returned that night they saw a roach in the bathroom but it was late and there was really no option at that late hour so they killed it and went to sleep.  The next morning they woke up and saw two more roaches which were also killed but they immediately packed up and alerted the front desk. They offered to spray the room but they let them know they were checking out. They originally only refunded them for the nights they were not staying.   When I went to pick them up I requested them to also be refunded for the first night because of the inconvenience and the added costs of booking another hotel last minute. Thankfully the manager agreed to my request. As we were leaving we encountered another guest in the parking lot who stated they also had a roach issue in their room. So book here at your own risk or if roaches are not a problem for you.…,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d85039-Reviews-Quality_Inn_Miami_South-Miami_Florida.html
Castle Beach Suites by MiaRentals,hotels,"5445 Collins Ave, Miami, FL 33140-2568",No caigan en la trampa solo porque está en la playa. Muy sucio. Pésima atención. Nada funciona correctamente. Muy ruidoso. Solo tiene buena ubicación y salida a la playa. 200 palabras sobran para describir esta porquería,2.5,#134 of 155 hotels in Miami,"No final de 2013 fiquei nesse hotel, segue o relato na época: Localizado na beira da praia, fica um pouco distante de supermercados, farmácias, lanchonetes e do centrinho de Miami Beach, embora no LL possua um pequeno comércio, representante de locadora e agência de turismo. É possível se comunicar em espanhol e inglês, mas é preciso paciência no atendimento, pois normalmente só uma pessoa atende e como o checkin é demorado, acaba sendo muita gente aguardando. Informação importante: o checkin começa pontualmente às 15 horas. O estacionamento tem a vantagem de estar incluído no preço. Os quartos mais baratos têm vista para a baía, mas existem quartos com vista para o mar. Alguns quartos são bem amplos. Fiquei quase uma semana no quarto 616, com 4 aposentos. Com diária por volta dos U$ 50, pareceu-me ótima opção. Faço maior detalhamento do quarto abaixo, aqui direi o que faltava em cada um. Foi então que tudo mudou. Como estava muito satisfeito, paguei por mais uma semana, mesmo o preço tendo passado para mais de U$ 100. Mesmo manifestando o interesse de continuar no mesmo quarto, fui transferido para o quarto 525, com a vista do mar, mas mesmo a vista não agradou muito, pois via o mar, mas não a praia que era obstruída por um enorme terraço de cimento sem nenhum atrativo. Fiquei também com maior privacidade, pois agora não havia nenhum outro prédio em frente. Mas basicamente estas eram as únicas vantagens. Os responsáveis pelo flat [na verdade não é um hotel, é um flat administrado por algumas empresas] não gostavam que abrissem as janelas, que já tinham abertura bastante limitada, por conta da umidade litorânea, então acabei privado do frescor do vento marítimo. As cortinas não eram suficientes para cortar a luz do sol, então era acordado ao amanhecer. A cozinha era minúscula, mas como estava sozinho, suficiente. Era interessante o banheiro que tinha 2 enormes espelhos no teto, parecia um motel, mas foi legal. A internet do 5º andar mostrou problema durante todo o período, mas em determinado momento consegui pegar um sinal do 6º andar que conseguiu suprir o problema. O fardo foi o teste do alarme de incêndio no dia em que ocupei o quarto. De repente aquele sinal tocando fortíssimo – tinha um ramal dentro do meu quarto – como não fora avisado do teste, saí do quarto preocupado, pois por todo o corredor as luzes de fire piscavam, além do forte barulho. Durante todo o dia, este alarme tocou 6 vezes, 2 depois da meia-noite, repito, sem qualquer aviso. Só na manhã seguinte, quando questionei, fui informado que este inconveniente cessaria. Também, pela forma como o sol iluminava o chão, era visível, como direi, que o chão estava ensebado. Continua: no dia útil após o feriado, começaram uma reforma na parte externa [sobre a laje] às 06h45min da manhã. Não dá. Tive problemas no uso do fogareiro elétrico e a tomada precisou de todo o tamanho do fio do notebook [que era muito comprido]. Ainda neste apartamento no penúltimo dia ocorreu uma infestação de barata, acredito que jogaram veneno em algum lugar e elas estavam tentando escapar pelo meu apartamento, é a única explicação para não ter visto nenhuma [apenas algumas miúdas] e de um dia para outro ter quase 10 que corriam desesperadamente. Brotavam de todo lugar, mas principalmente da cozinha e banheiro. Durante minha estada neste apartamento, tentei, por várias vezes, trocar, mas foi inútil. Como já tinha comprado mais uma semana, ficou decidido que no início do novo período seria mudado. Então veio o golpe final para “coroar” esse péssimo período: no dia da troca, foi exigido que fizesse o checkout às 11 horas, como um hóspede que estava indo embora, e que aguardasse até às 15 horas para fazer o novo checkin para o outro apartamento. Dá para acreditar? Você hospedado há quase 2 semanas, querendo prestigiar o estabelecimento com a compra de mais uma semana, te obrigam a fazer o checkout, aguardar 4 horas para então fazer novo checkin. ABSURDO. O apartamento 1708 era muito bom. Não tinha tantos aposentos como o primeiro, mas o igualava em vários aspectos. Diferente do apartamento anterior neste tinha um ótimo iPod dock da marca iLuv com ótimo som estéreo além de muito bonito. Ainda fazia o que todo dock de iPod deve fazer: carregava-o. Como não precisei da administração durante esta última semana, então acabou sendo um período também muito bom. Basicamente os problemas foram o chuveiro que não tinha muita pressão, o cofre também apresentou problemas na tranca [acredito que além de estar um pouco empenado, acho que as pilhas estavam no fim]. Todos os apartamentos tinham: cama box [o colchão estava vencido em alguns], cômoda, criado, TV LCD, vários canais a cabo. No outro ambiente, sofá, mesinha com 4 cadeiras, abajur, guarda-roupa embutido com cofre e ferro de passar – nos de 3 ambientes, este era integrado ao quarto. Na cozinha americana, tinha um pequeno fogareiro elétrico e quantidade de panelas, talheres e pratos, suficientes para 4 pessoas preparar uma pequena refeição. O banheiro tipicamente americano, com o tradicional chuveiro desaguando sobre uma banheira. O chuveiro quente agradou bastante. Os quartos aqui oferecem uma profusão de tomadas e bons lugares para você usar ligar seu notebook sem problemas. O inconveniente é que todos os quartos têm ligações através de uma porta e por essa é possível escutar sons dos outros hóspedes, influindo na privacidade e sono.  A piscina não estava totalmente limpa, tinha areia da praia em alguns lugares, mas nada que atrapalhasse o uso. Tem uma lavanderia self-service com preços razoáveis [U$ 3 para lavar e secar], o problema é exige apenas moedas de 25 cents, ou seja, para fazer tudo serão necessárias 12 moedas. Os elevadores são velhos, parecem perigosos, necessitam urgentemente de manutenção. Considerando os preços em algumas ocasiões, avalio como positiva minha experiência no Design Suites At Castle Beach Hotel Miami Beach [cuidado, pois é conhecido por vários nomes]. Como puderam perceber existe muita diferença entre os quartos, embora haja disposição da administração em nivelá-los, o que pode representar uma ótima estada, e consequentemente, passeio. Infelizmente, a administração não teve acuidade para trocar-me de apartamento quando manifestei meu incômodo, por isso o atendimento perderá bons pontos com isso.  Não indico por causa de falhas administrativas que representaram um grande inconveniente. Os quartos são bons, os elevadores são velhos e mal conservados, mas depende muito do preço também, para o período de férias, a diária já estava batendo na casa dos U$ 150 (lembrem-se começou com pouco mais de 50 para uma pessoa), elevadíssimo, batendo até mesmo redes conceituadíssimas e bem avaliadas, mas talvez a localização seja decisiva, caso queira ficar próximo a praia.…",5,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d20904267-Reviews-Castle_Beach_Suites_by_MiaRentals-Miami_Florida.html

We missed blackout curtains in the bedrooms and also a nice curtain in the living room to make it more cosy and double glazing in order to block out outside noise. In fact, there is a lot of noise from aeroplanes flying over all the time and also from the railway. With a little bit of updating (modern bathroom and revamped kitchen) this could easily become an even better (self catering) place to stay for periods of five days or more.

Setting up the room block and booking and working with group housing team was good. But that’s it. Everything else was the complete opposite. Communication at this hotel is literally 0. Weekend of room block/event: First of all, the front desk was severely short staffed and checking in was a nightmare. I also had several guests who had issues with their rooms. Hotel again was short staffed so no one was able to help them. Broken shower, Cribs that were promised were not delivered, my father needed a wheelchair accessible room. The room was classified as “handicapped accessible” but was not accessible for his wheelchair, specifically. Separately, I had major issues with the event staff. The event manager that was assigned to me was horrific, no communication at all, and at the end overcharged me a significant amount beyond the contract we agreed. This was ultimately resolved later on after hard pushes to finally talk to the event director. I tried calling multiple times to get the GM of the hotel, left messages with her assistant and general mailbox to express how upset I was with the entire experience, and went completely ignored.

Aloft Miami - Brickell,hotels,"1001 SW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33130-4009","I had been here for a stay on a business trip just a few months back in March of 2023. This stay had convinced me actually that I wanted to stay again on a trip last weekend with my daughter on our annual daddy-daughter back to school shopping trip (July 2023), and I was disappointed.    In March when there on business there was a decent warm breakfast each morning that was well stocked for what it was.  There was nothing this past visit and the room that they set it up in was constantly half blocked off to even enter by a line control type barrier.  Also, on the previous trip the hotel advertises this happy hour of sorts in the lobby where there are some small bites and a little gathering that is shown based on the posters in the elevators to run from 4pm to 11pm I believe.  In March, it was a nice added touch. This trip it was non-existent despite the signs still being posted advertising it.  Also, despite no smoking signs throughout the floors, there was a very strong smell of marijuana in the elevators and at least the hallway of the floor we stayed on - 8th floor.   This all in addition to some hassles at check-in because of a reservation confusion that I had called about weeks ahead and was assured was not an issue, but was when I checked in.  Because of one good experience and a great location for this hotel, I am not saying I would not stay here again, but I will look into other places when I come to Miami again.…",4.0,#67 of 155 hotels in Miami,"We chose this hotel based on location and price.

OB Suites Brickell Miami,condos,"1451 S Miami Ave, Miami, FL 33130-4306","Hi  We stayed at OB Brickell for 3 nights and had a great time. I contacted the venue several month in advance and they always responded very quick! When we arrived we had a great welcome and everything was arranged very good. As we were with a large group it wasn’t easy to have everybody close due to the different types of appartments but at almost every floor we had an appartment ( 4 floors ) the swimming pool is just lovely on the 9th or 10th floor. Nice and peacefull. The suites were amazing as it was our second visit so we knew what to expect ( big rooms, full kitchen, good sofa, nice view from the terras, laundry washer,...) 21 people who joined us said it was beautiful. Thanks for the perfect stay after our wedding day!!!  ",4.5,#2 of 28 condos in Miami,"Spent two nights here with our family of six in mid-December. We had a corner suite on the 22nd floor of this 36 storey building. Lots of space. Very clean. Great view of Brickell and we could even see the Port of Miami. Two BR and two bath, with king bed in master and two queens in the other room. Living space could use a bit more furniture - chairs for kitchen table and accent chairs. Unfortunately, the handle to the balcony door was broken so we couldn't access the balcony.  It rained for most of our stay so we weren't able to enjoy the outdoor pool and jacuzzi (or indoor sauna). We bought some groceries and had a few meals in the suite. It was stocked with the essentials - except a dish towel. (We brought our own from home based on reading other reviews.) We rented a car so it was great to have a parking space included. Check in and check out were a breeze.

Magic City Farm,ranch,"281 NE 84th St, Miami, FL 33138-3918","First, let me sum up my review for the busy readers: This is an interesting option, but it is not a hotel and it is certainly not for everybody. That said, it can be quite charming...if you are in the mood for a very laid-back, down and dirty trip to Miami. The rooms are a series of unattached bungalows. These are about 20 years older than the city itself (founded around 1899). When I stayed, it was cold (between 70-50 F) and the walls afforded little warmth. However, they are not designed for sub070 temperatures and you are not likely to encounter them anyway. The rooms are decorated in a very sweet way. No little sculpture or scarf-as-window-tie seems to have been an afterthought. There are odd cabinets and shelves all over as well, which lends it a certain quaint charm. This is a farm, though, so water use is limited and the showers are not the best. Perhaps that is because there's an outdoor shower for guest use. There is also a main bungalow where you can keep coffee and milk in a communal refrigerator. The common bungalow is also pleasant, has a warm and inviting living room area and is a nice place to chat with other guests if you are so inclined.  This is a farm and it is situated in an area near Little Haiti that is not altogether wholesome. But it is a farm...meaning there are thousands of plant species burgeoning at every corner. There's a pig. There are ducks and chickens and an entire *gang* of very friendly dogs who wander in the wake of owner Tamara as she tends to various tasks around the premises. Tamara is very friendly, always up for a chat--long or short.   Now, the fact that it is a farm does make the setting kind of alternative and enchanting. However, if you are planning to enjoy the nightlife and have a series of urban events planned, this is not the place to be. It's a FARM! That means that although it is beautiful, there is plenty of dirt, animal run-ins etc. I suppose it is self-selecting. I enjoyed my stay--had I been there for fun rather than for business, I might have had a great time. As it was, it was despite being a farm that I enjoyed my stay.…",4.5,#1 of 1 ranch in Miami,"Wer perfekte Hotel-Zimmer mit Standard-Einrichtung liebt, der wird sich hier vermutlich nicht wohl fühlen, aber wir haben unsere drei Nächte in Tamara's kleinem Paradies geliebt! Das Boathouse Downstairs und eins der Cottages hatten wir als reisendes Paar mit Single-Freundin über AirBnB gefunden und uns sofort in den ganz eigenen Shabby-Chic-Look verliebt. Die Magic City Farm liegt im Little Haiti-Viertel und damit ca 5 Autominuten vom Design-District und etwa 15 Autominuten max. von South Beach entfernt. Vom ersten Eindruck der etwas ärmlichen Nachbarschaft sollte man sich nicht abschrecken lassen, man lebt und wohnt hier so sicher wie an vielen anderen Orten in Miami. Wir haben in ca. 5 Autominuten ein tolles Restaurant ""The District"" gefunden, das offensichtlich zahlungskräftige Kundschaft anzieht und so eine Art Hotspot zu sein scheint. Die Zimmer selber sind mit viel Phantasie und Liebe zum Detail eingerichtet und die vielen Hunde, Katzen, Enten, Hühner sowie das Hängebauchschwein und der (Tamara perfekt imitierende) Papagei sorgen für die richtige Farm-Atmosphäre. Für Lenny Kravitz und diverse Foto-Shooting-Teams war dies anscheinend eine perfekte Location...und wir schliessen uns dieser Meinung voll und ganz an: Gotta go there!…",2,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d2708279-Reviews-Magic_City_Farm-Miami_Florida.html

Please read past the poor ratings, most of them are only about the shuttle, or a one time issue the hotel could not necessarily prevent.  I travel to Miami 2-3 times per year and have been looking for a new hotel to use, this one has won me over.  Many of the ""staple hotel"" properties (I have previously used) have gone downhill due to covid.  Or they won't update their properties and have watered down the member benefits.   Here was my experience in July of 2022.  Super-fast check-in, in fact they allowed me to check-in 3 hours early.  Breakfast was on the 10th floor from 6-9:30 and was a little different each day.  Always plenty of fruit, eggs, oatmeal, waffles, and other breakfast items.  The attendants worked hard to keep it stocked and clean.  My room was very new and clean.  Had a small fridge which was also nice.  No microwave but they have one near the front desk if you need to warm something.  Only room downside was no dresser drawers, or other real space for placing clothes.  But they do have hooks on the wall and some hangers along with a bar to hang clothes on.   We loved our view of the lagoon, it was busy with row boats.  Never waited more than one minute for an elevator.   The  10th floor is great.  Great big open space with a pool table, foosball table, board games, and lots of spaces to relax & plug your device in.   All with a great view of the lagoon or the airport.   We did not hear much (if any) airplane noise, the hotel is not on the departure/arrival corridor so it's quiet, yet you still have a great view of the airfield.  As a pilot so I pay attention to these details!  The gym (10th floor) was not bad, up to 75lb dumbbells and space to spread out for 4-5 people working out.  I'm picky about gyms, and felt this one serves you well, especially for a medium size hotel.  The staff was all friendly and available if needed.   No real perks for Diamond members but they did give me a 3:30pm late checkout which was a lifesaver.    10 minutes or less to the airport, if traffic builds it might be 15.  Easy to get on/off the highway, yet you don't feel close to it when you're at the hotel.  There is a Starbucks 3 minute (walk) along with Chipotle & Panda Express.  If you need more, there is a Publix within walking distance, 5-10 minutes away, depending on busy street traffic you have to cross. I also found out they have FREE laundry on the first floor, WOW!  2 washers and 2 dryers which fill quickly, but hey its FREE, at least as of me writing this in July 2022.      I will absolutely come back!  I almost passed this up due to the negative ratings on Trip Advisor and Google.   I did NOT use the airport shuttle so I cannot review the service.  Honestly though, I tend to Uber anyways because I feel all hotel shuttles are ""hit and miss"".  It doesn't take much for a hotel shuttle to get overwhelmed with guests, many whom all arrive/depart near the same time.   Most hotels only have one driver so they get behind easy.    Ubers still work pretty well in Miami and that's what I use if I don't want to chance the shuttle.       Great job TRU Hilton, please continue the great work.  It's been a relief finding a hotel this great, and during a time when many hotels cannot provide adequate service, staff or fall short on needed updates.  I travel 3-4 days per week and see hotels all over the country, this one is on my top 10 right now.…",72,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d23633036-Reviews-Tru_By_Hilton_Miami_Airport_South_Blue_Lagoon_Fl-Miami_Florida.html

Got to my room it was sprayed with Lysol... must have been the whole can. Rooms are small bed was comfortable sheet was clean ... room was not as clean as it could have been had popcorn under my bed room was dusty and they had roaches.... I did advised the owner she stated when it rains they come in... 2nd night room smelled like BBQ because our room was right on the side of a park where there was chickens and alot of home less people cooking on a grill which made my clothes also smell. Microwave didn't work fridge was clean and worked. Shower curtain liner was cheap looking ... the concept is great just needs to work on better customer service and cleaner the rooms ...the have free breakfast but the food was old I did ask about fresh fruit for 2 days .. front desk lady stated owner didn't get time to go to the store there was a microwave in that little break area but it also was old and dirty. The front desk has a mirror so you can see behind the front desk... it was junky and dirty as can be... very shocked since it was 3 women who I saw working there. See pictures. Over all I would not stay there again ...unless I absolutely had to. Parking is offering on the side of the building. You get a paper pass to put in window. This could really be a beautiful place to experience if the owner.. well it's 3 women owners buy the one shorter one who was there had better people skills. And treated her employees better. To offer breakfast and not have fresh items to eat was confusing to me .. just don't offer anything if the food is rotten. And purchase a new microwave, it's old rusty and dirty.  Hire a professional painter and  cleaners. DONT have front desk cleaning rooms unless they have been trained to. And get the hotel under a pest control contract.

Cabins at Oleta River State Park,campgrounds,"Oleta River State Park, Miami, FL 33160-4460",We stayed Mon-Thr just before Thanksgiving and had a great time. I will share some tips that I wish I had before going.  Plan on cleaning the cabins a little before settling in. There is some level of cleaning done but if you are a clean person you will probably want to do more. There are no brooms or anything in the cabins so bring your own if necessary.  They are strict about not letting you into the cabin much before 4:00 pm even if the cabin has been unoccupied for a week. They did let a member of our group check in at 3:15 and get access to the cabin which was a surprise. We had arrived a little after lunch and were told to come back at 4:00.  There is nowhere to set anything in the bathroom / shower area. There are a couple of hooks and that's it. There are no benches or anything. You have to be creative with your stuff. It's also tricky because you are likely trying to touch as little as possible during COVID times. Other then that the bathrooms are pretty clean and were never crowded when we visited.  Each cabin has both a grill and a fire pit which has a grill that can be moved in or out. I would recommend buying your firewood from the grocery store ($6/bundle). They sell wood in the park as well but it may be from fallen trees and seems to burn faster then the hardwood from the store (Publix). We enjoyed the grills and the fire pits.  There are lots of mosquitos and no see ums particularly at dusk and dawn. Bring spray.  There is a kayak put in very close to the cabins if you bring your own kayaks. We had a great time and found a variety of conditions. There is interior mangrove paddling that is very calm regardless of the winds. There are other areas that can be quite challenging in heavy winds. We had fun on our paddle.  There are a lot of mountain bike trails. The signs say they require helmets. There is also some casual bike riding in the park.  We had raccoons (we think) open up out cooler and take a lot of food. I would suggest bringing your cooler into the cabin or securing it well. We lost a lot of good food at night to the little bandits. There are stores within a couple of miles from the park if needed.   One of the days we did an excursion to Calle Ocho or Little Havana. We enjoyed it and the food was very reasonably priced. There is a  lot of Cuban Heritage to experience. We also visited Wynwood Walls which is a lot of nice murals in a somewhat sketch area. It's fine to drive around but everyone may not want to walk around there at night. It also seems like a decent size area to walk. You could probably walk a few miles to see all of the murals on multiple streets. South Beach is also close by and is an interesting place to experience.…,3.5,#3 of 3 campgrounds in Miami,"We are from Canada and this the second time we drove to Miami to stay at Oleta State Park. We like the Park because it combines the outdoor, kayaking and Miami facilities and of course the A/C in the cabin is a must!  We have our kayaks and we love the inter coastal waters.  The showers are decent and the management was very nice this time with the family and the park host who take care of cleanness and the rules in the park. We loved everything except the no-see-ums and they are a lot!!!   From here you can visit Miami, Everglades National Park and The Keys!

The air vents were extremely moldy making it hard to breathe.  Paint was peeling.  There were holes in the wall with toilet paper shoved in them.  And the shuttle only runs once an hour, something that they do not tell you that is critical to know.  Further, there are no restaurants or drug stores.  My son and I had to cross 8 lanes of traffic to get to a shell station and the walk light was out due to construction.   The hotel shop lacks in basic traveler needs like toothpaste or toothbrushes.  And while they have a washer/dryer on site they have no change machines and the front desk told me they do not give change and only had 2 quarters in the register.    It would take me 5 minutes to spackle holes in the wall and repaint.  It's not difficult.  Further, it would not take a lot of effort to keep quarters for customers by going to the bank once a week.  There's no extra hotel expense for this.    While I understand this is a budget stay these simple things indicate to me the manager simply does not care about offering a decent hotel even with the minimal efforts.  It is noisy but it is an airport hotel.  We ended up ordering UberEats which charged us $40 for a 12 inch pizza and $40 for one Chipotle burrito.  Local businesses price gouge because they know you have no car and nothing around to eat within walking distance.  That said spend an $30 bucks.

There was an issue of double booking the first night we stayed there. And it wasn't any of the staff's fault but it was incredibly frustrating that we had our stay booked for a few months in advanced, had called and checked in on our flight over, and then after arriving later than normal we find out that the shuttle is not running 24 like some websites cited. After finally getting there we find that the rooms were all completely full or dirty. The one front desk person (peter I think) was kind enough to go and clean some dirty rooms for us (even though it wasn't in his job description) and was able to help us finally into our rooms about 3:30. He was phenomenal. However the next morning when we talk to the staff about refunding (we gave up one of our rooms for another guest who also didn't have a place to stay). They staff was unfriendly and not helpful. Then when we asked about the free shuttle we were informed that it only goes once an hour and will only fit 11 people. They were unwilling to make any other trips or accommodation. Which is incredibly frustrating because they advertise as a hotel to stay at before/after the cruise. So people are needed to be at the airport and by people I mean 50+ so it is IMPOSSIBLE to get a ride to the shuttle and makes it a pretty much worthless unless you are one of the lucky 11 individuals. That was just the first stay. After our cruise we stayed here again (against our wishes because we already booked months ago) and the rooms were filthy. Yellow stains on the sheets and the bedspread crumbs and sticky substances on the night stand. Dirt and garbage in the corners of the room, no toilet paper, etc. And that is just the room. The pool was also filled with trash and the outside furniture was covered in garbage and debris. To make matters just slightly more frustrating. Some of the cleaning staff was asleep on a couch in the room across from ours. We wanted to start our cruise well rested and then wanted to rest and relax before starting our travels home and we didn't get either. It was a truly awful experience.

Excepcional, him and his team, even working under very demanding conditions of high heat, rain, and lots of guests coming and going all the time.  As an example: we had this one request where we needed to get the Apple TV app installed in one of the TV's to be able to watch Messi's debut for the Inter Miami.  The receptionists talked to engineering and in no time we had the engineers in our room helping us set up the app on the TV (outside of the Tivo ecosystem they have) and we were able to watch the match in the room.  They even left us the TV remote so we could watch the match that was coming the next week as well :)  They also helped us find a good solution for extra late-checkout and in general they were always there when we needed them.  The pool is amazing, great for both adults and kids of all ages.  The hotel provides towels so you don't need to think about that.

Aloft Miami - Brickell,hotels,"1001 SW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33130-4009","I had been here for a stay on a business trip just a few months back in March of 2023. This stay had convinced me actually that I wanted to stay again on a trip last weekend with my daughter on our annual daddy-daughter back to school shopping trip (July 2023), and I was disappointed.    In March when there on business there was a decent warm breakfast each morning that was well stocked for what it was.  There was nothing this past visit and the room that they set it up in was constantly half blocked off to even enter by a line control type barrier.  Also, on the previous trip the hotel advertises this happy hour of sorts in the lobby where there are some small bites and a little gathering that is shown based on the posters in the elevators to run from 4pm to 11pm I believe.  In March, it was a nice added touch. This trip it was non-existent despite the signs still being posted advertising it.  Also, despite no smoking signs throughout the floors, there was a very strong smell of marijuana in the elevators and at least the hallway of the floor we stayed on - 8th floor.   This all in addition to some hassles at check-in because of a reservation confusion that I had called about weeks ahead and was assured was not an issue, but was when I checked in.  Because of one good experience and a great location for this hotel, I am not saying I would not stay here again, but I will look into other places when I come to Miami again.…",4.0,#67 of 155 hotels in Miami,"My husband and I stayed here for one night before an appt with my surgeon.

As we approached our room, there were two huge housekeeping carts piled high with junk (looked like they were used for storage?).  We opened the door and the same smell was in our room along with a dusty smell.  I have terrible allergies and it was hard for me to get to sleep.  There was dust/hair on the bathroom floor and it felt like an old dorm room or a shady Vegas hotel.  The sliding doors were unlocked when we got into the room, so good thing we checked them before bed.    The next morning, my husband went down to get breakfast for us.  He said all the hot plates with covers were empty.  Two other business men came in and stated that this was not what they paid for.  My husband was able to grab an apple and packaged oatmeal.    We were very ready to get out of the hotel, and finish our day in Miami before heading home!  I could not imagine staying in this hotel for days on end with that smell and the dirt.

She does not make you feel welcome at all and to the contrary is very nonchalant with the entire checkin process.   This time she (and the Lady following her shift) both lied through their teeth about me not having presented my photo ID to them upon check-in due to  which they could not check me in and apologized for the “inconvenience” while I was helplessly leaving to make a reservation at the hotel next-door (which had no issues checking me in since It was a Marriott with a digital checkin process) … if I were to subpoena them and request video footage of the front desk security cameras it would clearly become obvious that my photo ID was the first thing I handled them followed by her flurry of excuses.   They then tried to backtrack (after I made a reservation and checked into the hotel next-door) that they were not able to refund my booking and if I want to come back and present my photo ID (which I had done to begin with before I left disappointed and inconvenienced) then they would be able to check me in. If only she had done the right thing to begin with and gone the extra mile to provide better customer service and act a little less like everyone was bothering here then this Choice Hotel would’ve probably avoided this review.   I noticed that the owner Sonese Eccleston responds selectively to only positive reviews … let’s see if this review draws her attention towards the unpleasant  front desk lady’s less than mediocre customer service skills.   If you read other reviews you will notice that I am not the only one who has had a problem with this lady at the front desk… It is a recurring issue which Choice hotels has failed to address in the past with complete disregard to how it is affecting their brand name.…,850,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d4451262-Reviews-Cambria_Hotel_Miami_Airport_Blue_Lagoon-Miami_Florida.html

Relaxation is as close as the luxurious spa and the unique stainless steel pool.",4.0,#69 of 155 hotels in Miami,"The statement 'employees deal with complaints well' is not meant as a compliment.  It should prompt the question 'why are complaints happening in the first place?'.  The hotel is currently going through some renovation work.  Not a problem as all hotels experience this at some point and the hotel has been quite transparent in disclosing this on its website.  Should I really need to complain though about drilling right above my head at 7:30am?  The drilling stopped as soon as I called reception, but drilling should not have been occurring above occupied rooms at 7:30am.  The construction noise continued for the next few days, but was not too intrusive so I was patient and thought 'oh well .... one of those things'.  My patience ran out though when power was cut to my room ..... 'twice'.  At that point I requested a room change, which was accommodated without fuss and with apologies (I was upgraded .... for which I thank you).  I cannot fault the way in which it was dealt, but .... again .... it is not a situation that should have arisen.  I should not have to complain about construction work cutting the power to my room.  One thing that really annoyed me was a back office associate hanging up on calls.  Due to my work there were times I had to eat in my room (I did get out and enjoy Miami at other times .... I promise).  I therefore called the 'at your service' line which goes through to the back office behind reception.  The first time my call was either disconnected or the associate hung up.  I called again ..... same thing.  The third time she did not disconnect the call but let it ring until she was able to answer it.  At that point I was pretty p'd off so told her not to bother.  I fully appreciate that people can be busy, but ask yourself, should she:  a - pick up the phone and say ""I am so sorry I am currently dealing with another guest, I will be with you momentarily"", or b - pick up the phone and say ""I am so sorry I am currently dealing with another guest, I will call you back within the next 5 minutes"", or c - ignore the guest and disconnect the call like you would in a budget motel.  When I complained it was explained that 'she was new'.  You should not have to train people on common sense.  She also neglected to inform her manager that she had disconnected my call twice before answering it.  I do not pay over $500 a night (including taxes) to get an associate disconnect my calls.   Just a little tip about concierge rooms.  A concierge room gives you access to the concierge lounge.  The canapes and snacks from 5pm are pretty good, but that really is the only benefit.  Apart from water and sodas, all drinks have to be paid for.  This may be the norm in Miami, but when we have stayed in concierge rooms in Australia, Asia and also on US cruise lines, drinks tend to be complimentary.  I am not talking about drinking enough to sink a battleship ...... but a complimentary glass of wine or two for concierge guests wouldn't kill you.  This may be the norm for Americans .... but those not from the US may like to take note.  The concierge room is also completely soulless.  I would happily forgo a free breaded shrimp and buy my wine in a bar outside with atmosphere.       Other minor issues like a $50 a day parking fee being added to my bill for a car I did not have and did not park.  The employees are all gracious and polite, but the problems at this hotel are more the fault of senior management rather than frontline staff.  Frontline staff deal with complaints wonderfully ...... but the point is that the complaints shouldn't be happening in the first place.  Would I stay here again ...... NO.…",1257,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d223040-Reviews-JW_Marriott_Miami-Miami_Florida.html

The service is top-notch, and housekeeping responds to your requests immediately. The L-shaped rooftop pool with views over Bayside is terrific, as is the gym, which takes up two floors. The look is sleek and modern, and we had a full kitchen with dishwasher, plus a washer/dryer (we used that three times over six days, and it was great to have). The panel-mounted TV in the middle could be swiveled to face either bed. The staff are extremely friendly, and there is literally not one bad thing to say about this hotel. So if you want to rock at the beach but prefer to stay in a quiet, extremely clean, completely modern hotel downtown - we were 45 floors above the noise - this is perfect. And the rooftop pool with a jacuzzi pool nestled one floor above that really tips the scales in favor of The Elser. Plus you get the great view of Liberty Tower lit up at night (perhaps downtown Miami's only real historical building with loads of character).  Even if you have no room view of Liberty Tower, you can see that lit up at night every day from the pool, gym, or spaces near the pool. Same with Bayside and its Ferris wheel lit up at night.

My son & I found it to be perfect for our needs.

Never had that before.   Anyway, on arrival the same lady explained the valet parking arrangements (35$ per day)  and checked us in. We had a number of questions to help orientate ourselves and she answered them all with good grace. She then topped everything by offering us a free upgrade to a suite overlooking the bay on the 26th floor. Wow!! Very many thanks!!!  The suite had everything we could possibly need. Two bedrooms with large double beds. One had an en-suite bathroom with a shower in the bathtub. There was a separate dressing room with a small safe (unfortunately too small for my laptop.). There was a separate bathroom next to the other bedroom, a fully equipped kitchen with fridge, dishwasher, oven, hob and microwave. In another cupboard we found (and used) the washing machine and tumbler dryer. In total we counted three large flat screen TVs and once having worked magic with the technical details we were able to follow a European soccer match live via my laptop and the connection to the largest TV in the main sitting room area. The free WiFi was excellent. I drank all the coffee made available including much of the extra sachets sent up to the room on the second day.   I started each day with an early morning mug of coffee relaxing on the small balcony overlooking the bay.   By the way, everything was spotlessly clean and all the furnishing were modern and complemented the place perfectly.   All in all this was an excellent start for our three week father/son road trip along the east coast of the USA. …",588,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d120376-Reviews-Fortune_House_Hotel-Miami_Florida.html

We arrived at 1:30 pm and thought we would ask to see if early check in was available. At the front desk we were offered the opportunity to check in early for a extra $50.  I politely said never mind we will wait until 3pm.    We had a flight out of Miami the next morning so thought staying at the airport after our cruise was a good option considering Uber, shuttles, etc are expensive for a family of 5 with tons of luggage.  Big mistake!  If I had paid for the early check in with the conditions of this hotel I think I would have lost my mind and canceled the entire reservation.  I was so tempted many times.  But traveling with a infant and 2 other kids was tiring enough that my husband and I said we would stay since we were flying out less than 12 hours later.    PRO:  The hotel is centrally located within the Miami airport. (Departure area)  That’s literally the only pro.. this place has nothing else going for them.    CONS:  1. As soon as we stepped out of the elevator on our way to the room we were presented with the most musty smell.  The paint is chipping and dingy and the carpet is extremely stained.   2. Once we entered the room we were all shocked that the photos looked NOTHING like what we stepped into.    3. The far end of the room was covered in dingy shutters.  (Like the entire wall ) and there was a small opening to a window behind the shutters.  (Extremely weird set up)  4. The beds were not comfortable and at one point we considered if it’s acceptable to just sleep in the airport waiting area instead.  5.  I did not want my kids to take off there socks.  The carpet looks like it has never been changed….ever since the hotel was created.  6. I was not happy with the gross sounds the toilet made after flushing.  7. The electrical outlets are ancient.  One of my kids asked if it was safe to plug up her charger using the outlet and I honestly couldn’t give her a straight answer.  The chargers are also randomly placed.    I would never stay here again.  Just spring for something you know and take the shuttle or Uber.  The extra cost is worth your comfort and sanity.    Convenience is the only thing keeping this place afloat.  Ditch this hole in the wall and stay somewhere comfortable and clean. lol…",3767,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d87084-Reviews-Miami_International_Airport_Hotel-Miami_Florida.html

I was transferred to the accounting department, which was closed, and no supervisor was available. This is unacceptable. I will not be sending clients to this hotel ever again.

This stay had convinced me actually that I wanted to stay again on a trip last weekend with my daughter on our annual daddy-daughter back to school shopping trip (July 2023), and I was disappointed.    In March when there on business there was a decent warm breakfast each morning that was well stocked for what it was.  There was nothing this past visit and the room that they set it up in was constantly half blocked off to even enter by a line control type barrier.  Also, on the previous trip the hotel advertises this happy hour of sorts in the lobby where there are some small bites and a little gathering that is shown based on the posters in the elevators to run from 4pm to 11pm I believe.  In March, it was a nice added touch. This trip it was non-existent despite the signs still being posted advertising it.  Also, despite no smoking signs throughout the floors, there was a very strong smell of marijuana in the elevators and at least the hallway of the floor we stayed on - 8th floor.   This all in addition to some hassles at check-in because of a reservation confusion that I had called about weeks ahead and was assured was not an issue, but was when I checked in.

However, being next door to a great strip club is about the only upside to this place.  First of all, being charged $112 on a weeknight is too much for a really small room with just a bed and night light.  The mattress was really squishy and the bed frame is really low off the floor.  The entire bed just felt rickety and cheap.  There is no fridge or microwave, and no TV in the room.  There is fast WiFi, though.  Seemed like a somewhat shady part of town but there is an electronic gate which makes you and your vehicle seem more secure, and they also have a security guard sitting in the parking lot all night (felt kinda bad for him).  There is also a pool which looks clean but I didn't try it out.  The front desk clerks seem a little odd, maybe baked from too many drugs?

Apparently it is supposed to have a sensor that shuts it off and turns it on but it did not work. We suffered through it because we didn’t want the headache of having to change rooms or having it fixed because it was late when we noticed. We decided to get the room another night and we informed the front desk about the bathroom light and asked them was there anything they could do about bathroom light and the young lady at the front desk said she could only inform maintenance and told me she would. I asked her was there anything she could do about our discomfort she said no.  No one ever came to fix the light, no one ever called to check, or even express their concern or apologize about it. I was very surprised to see Trip Advisor awards and stickers all over the hotel when we were totally disregarded and no one cared or fixed anything! This is the first time I have ever stay at a hotel associated with Trip Advisor and they showed a lack of concern. The last time we stayed the water in the shower would not get hot and the maintenance guy came and told us we had to put the water faucet between hot and cold for it to get hot instead of turning it to hot…..I have never seen anything like this.  We have never started more than two days at a time at this extended stay hotel and I probably never will because of there lack of concern and attention. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The hotel looks nice but it’s being held together by tape and bands aids…….. and no cares!

Cabins at Oleta River State Park,campgrounds,"Oleta River State Park, Miami, FL 33160-4460",We stayed Mon-Thr just before Thanksgiving and had a great time. I will share some tips that I wish I had before going.  Plan on cleaning the cabins a little before settling in. There is some level of cleaning done but if you are a clean person you will probably want to do more. There are no brooms or anything in the cabins so bring your own if necessary.  They are strict about not letting you into the cabin much before 4:00 pm even if the cabin has been unoccupied for a week. They did let a member of our group check in at 3:15 and get access to the cabin which was a surprise. We had arrived a little after lunch and were told to come back at 4:00.  There is nowhere to set anything in the bathroom / shower area. There are a couple of hooks and that's it. There are no benches or anything. You have to be creative with your stuff. It's also tricky because you are likely trying to touch as little as possible during COVID times. Other then that the bathrooms are pretty clean and were never crowded when we visited.  Each cabin has both a grill and a fire pit which has a grill that can be moved in or out. I would recommend buying your firewood from the grocery store ($6/bundle). They sell wood in the park as well but it may be from fallen trees and seems to burn faster then the hardwood from the store (Publix). We enjoyed the grills and the fire pits.  There are lots of mosquitos and no see ums particularly at dusk and dawn. Bring spray.  There is a kayak put in very close to the cabins if you bring your own kayaks. We had a great time and found a variety of conditions. There is interior mangrove paddling that is very calm regardless of the winds. There are other areas that can be quite challenging in heavy winds. We had fun on our paddle.  There are a lot of mountain bike trails. The signs say they require helmets. There is also some casual bike riding in the park.  We had raccoons (we think) open up out cooler and take a lot of food. I would suggest bringing your cooler into the cabin or securing it well. We lost a lot of good food at night to the little bandits. There are stores within a couple of miles from the park if needed.   One of the days we did an excursion to Calle Ocho or Little Havana. We enjoyed it and the food was very reasonably priced. There is a  lot of Cuban Heritage to experience. We also visited Wynwood Walls which is a lot of nice murals in a somewhat sketch area. It's fine to drive around but everyone may not want to walk around there at night. It also seems like a decent size area to walk. You could probably walk a few miles to see all of the murals on multiple streets. South Beach is also close by and is an interesting place to experience.…,3.5,#3 of 3 campgrounds in Miami,"We were in cabin # 9 which has twin bunk beds & Queen bed & is across Camp Host accommodations & bath/shower facilities.

I would like to mention specifically Vivika and Paula, they are top notch professionals. The daily complementary breakfast led by Chef Ismail was a daily dining experience. His daily creations made me look forward every day to a delicious meal. The rest of the breakfast items were always fresh and nutritious (fresh fruit, a full yogurt bar, gluten free options), nothing like other hotels where they just gave you bagels and coffee.

In the second room, OUR SHOWER WAS LEAKING TO THE OTHER 3 FLOORS BELOW US, so we had to use the bathroom in the room next door- which was completely dirty. The let us check out two hours later than usual with no charge, but checking out took about HALF AND HOUR, and the valet wanted to charge us way more than necessary.   While the views were gorgeous and I love Miami, it doesn't compensate for the bugs in the cabinets and lobby cushions, nor the awful attitudes of their staff. When we went down to complain, they started speaking in Spanish about us, thinking we couldn't understand them (we're all south american) and whoever seemed to be in charge could have been more difficult to cooperate with. She told us that they weren't going to change us from the second (leaky) room because housekeeping had gone home and every other room was booked or dirty.

The studio was comfortable and the kitchen accessible with the usual amenities. Nothing to say. Quiet and cosy overall. There is a pool too but it wasn't appealing. It is to be noted that we had a 50% discount on normal rates at roughly US$250 for 3 nights instead of US$500, which is then a rip-off.  There is no other form of services. A man waited for us to arrive and was extremely informal and dull. Don't expect a hotel service.

On arrival, there was a long check in line. This was not helped by the Atwell Suites front desk being used for luggage storage while checkin was shared with the Indigo front desk. I arrived a little early and my room was not ready. I was asked to wait 15 minutes, which seemed reasonable. Unfortunately this repeated three times before I was finally given a key. If I'd known it was going to be such a long wait, I could have left my bag and done something useful with my afternoon.  Since this the the flagship hotel for the Atwell Suites brand, I was expecting a newly refurbished room. It it had been newly refurbished, it had been done on the cheap. The sliding balcony doors did not seal properly, so I could hear every word of every announcement from the train station opposite. One of the windows was covered with paper. There were random closets that contained nothing, not even a shelf. The bathroom faucet was loose. This is not what I expect from a reputable brand in a major US city.  I raised my concerns and I was promised points would be credited to my account. I am still waiting a month later.

The hotel is well located, and the room was very clean.   However, the location of the room within the hotel made our stay a terrible one. We had the room number 601, which is neighboring to the 24/7 gym. This means that you get woken up by massive bangs that make your bed shakes (the bed is very smartly located on the wall shared with the gym).   Other inconveniences of the room such as the fact that you don’t see the sky from the window (massive wall in front) or that you very clearly hear all the noises from the hallway (it’s also in front of the lift and next to the pool), can be dealt with. But I highly doubt that even with the best earplugs on the market you can do anything to sleep/stay asleep when someone drops weights next to your head.   The hotel is big, and has enough rooms, very unsure why they decided to add a room there, and the bare minimum would be to warn the guests at reservation / check-in, and to sell it at a very low price. The correct way, however, would be to simply stop giving this room, as it doesn’t fit the main purpose of a room: sleep.   The staff was kind and managed to reduce the noise when we called them after having been woken up at midnight by someone using the gym, but it’s very uncomfortable if you need to call the front desk every night. We were then woken up again the same night at 6:00 - short nights for sure.  We asked for an internal feedback option, but the staff told us they didn’t have any and that if we were unhappy we had to go complain on TripAdvisor and that they’d read it.…",80,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d19121228-Reviews-Hotel_Indigo_Miami_Brickell_an_IHG_Hotel-Miami_Florida.html

More than half the hotel is residences.   It only offers valet parking and it is a typical city mess.    Busy as can be. When in Miami a good majority of support staff such as housekeeping and valet do not speak English.    Communication can be challenging at times.   We lost a set of keys and needed the valet to bring the car around so we could check the vehicle.    It was very hard to explain what we needed to do, however with patience  we managed.   :)  I hated the parking situation.   It was very stressful.  We called the front desk to ask for a bellhop to be sent up during check out. They said right away, so we called for our car.    The bellhop never showed.  We had to call again.  In the mean time I went to the car, while my husband waited in the room.   The valet staff made me feel like it was my fault our car was in the way for so long.     The room was terrific.  Beautiful, large and modern.   We had a great view of the marina and Biscayne Bay.    The pool was great, however pool towels are at the front desk, so when we got to the pool I had to go back to the front desk to get towels.    The pool closes at 10 sharp.   Security comes and politely chases you out.   There are a variety of shops attached to the hotel and a nice restaurant.  The only downside about the restaurant was someone came by, took our pictures and then tried to sell them to us.  It was just weird.     The hotel is located right next to a waterfront park.

Got to my room it was sprayed with Lysol... must have been the whole can. Rooms are small bed was comfortable sheet was clean ... room was not as clean as it could have been had popcorn under my bed room was dusty and they had roaches.... I did advised the owner she stated when it rains they come in... 2nd night room smelled like BBQ because our room was right on the side of a park where there was chickens and alot of home less people cooking on a grill which made my clothes also smell. Microwave didn't work fridge was clean and worked. Shower curtain liner was cheap looking ... the concept is great just needs to work on better customer service and cleaner the rooms ...the have free breakfast but the food was old I did ask about fresh fruit for 2 days .. front desk lady stated owner didn't get time to go to the store there was a microwave in that little break area but it also was old and dirty. The front desk has a mirror so you can see behind the front desk... it was junky and dirty as can be... very shocked since it was 3 women who I saw working there. See pictures. Over all I would not stay there again ...unless I absolutely had to. Parking is offering on the side of the building. You get a paper pass to put in window. This could really be a beautiful place to experience if the owner.. well it's 3 women owners buy the one shorter one who was there had better people skills. And treated her employees better. To offer breakfast and not have fresh items to eat was confusing to me .. just don't offer anything if the food is rotten. And purchase a new microwave, it's old rusty and dirty.  Hire a professional painter and  cleaners. DONT have front desk cleaning rooms unless they have been trained to. And get the hotel under a pest control contract.

Here are a FEW things upon my visit as I was solo : VERY bad part of town but could be workable if hotel was updates more like a house with rooms not a real hotel the window sill handles were broke the remote was missing from the room the weigh was written on a piece of paper AND everything at the front desk is on a piece of paper extra card transactions are on a manual paper leaving your personal information exposed was willing to pay for the first day no issues and the owner REFUSED to issue a refund after 2aM THE hotel had no one on staff which is one person staff at all times so you get a key to access a gate by yourself after hours THERES is no phone and the only person accessible by phone is the OWNER and we called her 5 times and there was no answer also when my card company called her she was not available still no credit etc I took pictures of the actual room and hotel to see how it really looks I love authenticity and I never write reviews but here it is and this is the truth no rooms are badly constructed or rehabbed for 149$ per night, go at your own risk and waster your money. The lady at the front was nice but they sit in front of the desk so your not aware if anyone works there.  The biggest part for me was no phone there in an unsafe neighborhood then the lady owner never answering her phone it says RIP OFF. hope they improve within time...…",7,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d20175139-Reviews-Dunns_Josephine_Hotel-Miami_Florida.html

Aloft Miami - Brickell,hotels,"1001 SW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33130-4009","I had been here for a stay on a business trip just a few months back in March of 2023. This stay had convinced me actually that I wanted to stay again on a trip last weekend with my daughter on our annual daddy-daughter back to school shopping trip (July 2023), and I was disappointed.    In March when there on business there was a decent warm breakfast each morning that was well stocked for what it was.  There was nothing this past visit and the room that they set it up in was constantly half blocked off to even enter by a line control type barrier.  Also, on the previous trip the hotel advertises this happy hour of sorts in the lobby where there are some small bites and a little gathering that is shown based on the posters in the elevators to run from 4pm to 11pm I believe.  In March, it was a nice added touch. This trip it was non-existent despite the signs still being posted advertising it.  Also, despite no smoking signs throughout the floors, there was a very strong smell of marijuana in the elevators and at least the hallway of the floor we stayed on - 8th floor.   This all in addition to some hassles at check-in because of a reservation confusion that I had called about weeks ahead and was assured was not an issue, but was when I checked in.

Miami Beaches are accessible as well within a short drive. There's no better way to enjoy the Florida sunshine than with Hyatt Regency Miami.",4.0,#50 of 155 hotels in Miami,"Background: I’m a business traveler. I am in many, many hotel rooms each year.  TIP: Even if you’re only staying at a particular hotel chain for one night, take a second while you’re sitting in the airport, and join their loyalty club. Hyatt’s is “World Of Hyatt”. I am a member of “World Of Hyatt”, “Hilton Honors”, and “Wyndam”, to name a few. There’s always an advantage.  First impressions: I’ve stayed at this hotel in the past. The lobby is cool and spacious. The front desk staff is friendly and efficient. Their “marketplace” shop actually has some nice grab n’ go food options. The marketplace restaurant next to it has some nice selections, with a bit of Southern flavor. Prices are what is expected inside a hotel. The market made me a $12 Cuban sandwich that was actually really good. On the other end of things, I was quoted $42.95 for the breakfast buffet. Can that be right?  I was in the hotel after that horrible first flight of the day that companies love to put me on, as it’s always cheaper. So, when I came into the hotel at 11am, I knew there was a possibility I could wait until as late as 4pm to check in. I also prefer a larger single bed than an extra bed in the room that I don’t use. They were able to accommodate me immediately, and had a single king bed room on the 20th floor (which they were careful to verify was okay with me. Some travelers don’t like heights.) Early check-in cost $25, which was easily worth it to me.   It was scheduled to rain heavily between 10 and 11am, so I was glad my World of Hyatt gave me the extra hour, to check out at noon.  The room showed no sign of wear whatsoever, meticulously maintained. The shower had what felt like decent pressure, although it was via an aerator, so even though the pressure was okay, washing off the body wash or shampoo took an extra minute. They feature Pharmacopeia bath products. As I am long past the time in life when I bring my tiny shampoo and conditioner bottles home, I was pleased that they use these refillable dispensers, and lowers the carbon footprint.  Airco worked efficiently, and without much noise. Everything, from the desk, to the lamps, to the coffee maker, seems to have been cleaned nicely.  Hyatt’s brand of bedding as absolutely fine, although I do prefer them labeling the pillows soft and hard, and to have a generally harder bed than their Wonder Bed (or whatever they call it).   The large flat screen TV has an HDMI jack, which business travelers love. Being able to put my own content on the big screen, or use it as a large extension monitor matters.  The mini fridge was clean and cold.  There was an alarm clock which was easily visible in the dark. That seems like a trivial thing, but several major chains actually don’t have alarm clocks, or they are over on the desk. They also have a white noise machine next to the bed.  Overall, a very nice stay, with a very professionally run hotel.…",1352,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d85027-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Miami-Miami_Florida.html

Cabins at Oleta River State Park,campgrounds,"Oleta River State Park, Miami, FL 33160-4460",We stayed Mon-Thr just before Thanksgiving and had a great time. I will share some tips that I wish I had before going.  Plan on cleaning the cabins a little before settling in. There is some level of cleaning done but if you are a clean person you will probably want to do more. There are no brooms or anything in the cabins so bring your own if necessary.  They are strict about not letting you into the cabin much before 4:00 pm even if the cabin has been unoccupied for a week. They did let a member of our group check in at 3:15 and get access to the cabin which was a surprise. We had arrived a little after lunch and were told to come back at 4:00.  There is nowhere to set anything in the bathroom / shower area. There are a couple of hooks and that's it. There are no benches or anything. You have to be creative with your stuff. It's also tricky because you are likely trying to touch as little as possible during COVID times. Other then that the bathrooms are pretty clean and were never crowded when we visited.  Each cabin has both a grill and a fire pit which has a grill that can be moved in or out. I would recommend buying your firewood from the grocery store ($6/bundle). They sell wood in the park as well but it may be from fallen trees and seems to burn faster then the hardwood from the store (Publix). We enjoyed the grills and the fire pits.  There are lots of mosquitos and no see ums particularly at dusk and dawn. Bring spray.  There is a kayak put in very close to the cabins if you bring your own kayaks. We had a great time and found a variety of conditions. There is interior mangrove paddling that is very calm regardless of the winds. There are other areas that can be quite challenging in heavy winds. We had fun on our paddle.  There are a lot of mountain bike trails. The signs say they require helmets. There is also some casual bike riding in the park.  We had raccoons (we think) open up out cooler and take a lot of food. I would suggest bringing your cooler into the cabin or securing it well. We lost a lot of good food at night to the little bandits. There are stores within a couple of miles from the park if needed.   One of the days we did an excursion to Calle Ocho or Little Havana. We enjoyed it and the food was very reasonably priced. There is a  lot of Cuban Heritage to experience. We also visited Wynwood Walls which is a lot of nice murals in a somewhat sketch area. It's fine to drive around but everyone may not want to walk around there at night. It also seems like a decent size area to walk. You could probably walk a few miles to see all of the murals on multiple streets. South Beach is also close by and is an interesting place to experience.…,3.5,#3 of 3 campgrounds in Miami,"We had a wonderful time at Oleta State Park Campground. It was not roughing it at all compared to sleeping in as tent!

The executive lounge where we had breakfast most of the time was always the same foods and drinks with no variety. The staff was friendly and well organised.  The issue for me was that Downtown Miami looks to me as after COVID it is becoming more dilapidated. Many shops have closed and the restaurants in walking distance have diminished from pre Covid times. So the area is less desirable although once you cross the bridge to Brickell the area is better and the restaurants are more desirable.  It's a nice hotel and location is acceptable.

And rest assured if you are using points or a rewards certificate you still have the privilege of paying this ridiculous fee.   In case the amenities fee was not enough, you will also be charged for parking a vehicle on site as well. I'm pretty sure the fee disclosed when I made the reservation was $21 per night but I was actually charged $23 plus another $5.06 in taxes.

We also notice that all of the windows were covered in bars.  My husband went to check in, and the check in clerk told him that he would show him some rooms for him to choose which would be suitable for our family.  Then, he told him that he needed his wife to check out the rooms as well....so, I went in.  The clerk seemed uncomfortable that we left our teenage children in the car as we were looking at the rooms.  ??  We saw several rooms--one had multiple cigarette burns in the carpet....a different one had pillows thrown at the foot of the beds with stuffing coming out.  We didn't have a good feeling about this place at all.  If you are going to the Miami area, pay the extra money to stay in a more reputable place.  We ended up not staying--and losing our $85.

It’s the reason I picked this hotel near the airport. In the future, I think I will be trying a different hotel. I frequent this area quite a bit since I have family here.  The staff was not so friendly at check in. I observe them dealing with a different customer at the front desk earlier in the day around 10:30 AM. The guest asked if they would be able to check into their room early. The response they got from the front desk wasn’t aggressive. There is a fee to check in early. of course they got an assertive response back off if the room is ready at check-in time of 3 PM do we get a discount? One woman responded appropriately saying that let’s worry about that if it happens. The other younger worker said I’m not going to answer that question, no you don’t get a discount.  Then they both went on to have a conversation while I stood there about how terrible customers are these days. Very inappropriate.  This whole building looks very worn out and appears to be in a not so great area area you don’t walk around at night. Luckily, you have to use your key card to get off the floor of your elevator.  I was also disappointed when I checked in that they didn’t do price matching. I’ve never been to Hampton Inn that didn’t do price matching. I literally had to stand there at the front desk and book online through a travel agency and wait for them to get the confirmation for 10 minutes so I can save $50.00 especially as a diamond member I found this extremely disappointing.  There is nothing pleasant about their attitudes. No friendliness no customer service nothing.  Since the Rams win to be ready until 3 PM we left came back much later in the day around 8:30 PM.

There was no wifi for an entire week, when we called they kept saying they were going to fix it (they never did). I had 7 days booked and only stayed for 4. There was a refund coming my way and they said with COVID they were a bit slow. I understood and waited... Its been 3 months, they avoid my phone calls and I have not received anything.",2.5,#23 of 28 condos in Miami,"I've stayed in the building before, but never in one of the NUOVO owned units, which was a mistake!  I suppose the $100 per visit (regardless of duration) ""cleaning fee"" was used to buy all the Clorox that was used in my room here what must have been like minutes before I entered my assigned unit-- a studio.  The place required airing out-- several hours, and the tub didn't benefit from the bleach-- it was still stained.  Then there were the stains on the carpets all the way down the halls, and the stain on the tiles and the crack across the glass window.  Granted, for a room booking that started with a highly attractive rate of ~$109 (for one night) that ended up being ~$245 because of the aforementioned ""cleaning fee"" of $100.00, and the fair taxes-- the proximity of One Broadway to Brickell Avenue doesn't seem that enticing for the real price.  I could have stayed at the Hotel Intercontinental for $245.  If the garbage room for the entire floor is next to your room and the entire hall reeks, maybe they should mention that in the room description?  Oh, and expect the owners of the units they have for rent here to go outside of the booking apps safe communications systems to send you emails demanding that you (actually require) you to email photos of your ID and credit cards (back and front) to some random gmail address top grant you room access.  And notice how they post the cleaning fee as ""$100"" without the decimal places (unlike all the other numbers in the charges) to make you think when your not looking that the fee might be One Dollar instead of $100.00.  And don't expect the hidden people you actually booked with to so much as reply to your email politely asking if they can reduce or waive the $100 per visit cleaning charge.  Nope.  But do expect a call asking for a photo of your ID from a perfect strange.  I'll never stay here again.  Oh-- but one good thing.  The room has a washer and dryer.  So you can you wash the sheets, and mattress protector before you dare to get into the bed.

My husband went inside to get us checked in only to experience a rude welcoming from the front desk staff member who looked at my husband as if he was a bomb off the street. Eventually, we got through that part. There was a front desk staff by the name of Dwayne we met the first night of our stay. He seemed to be God sent. He was very nice and he helped us to get over how we were treated once we first arrived. He truly made up for Jeremy’s bad customer service greeting. The housekeeping staff was OK but every day we were short on face cloths. And during checkout we were unaware of the different fees that were charged from the Hyatt hotel. We knew about the valet parking, but we didn’t know that there was a designation fee on top of that. So before staying with them, please make sure you have read and gotten a clear understanding of all the fees that they charge so you won’t be surprised at the end. We also had to pay a $600 security deposit. However, my husband and I met the general manager named Craig Haas when we were coming from the pool, and my husband explained the unwanted welcome that he received from Jeremy. The general manager handled it very well, and he also provided us with a bottle of champagne and a nice card on our last night of staying at the Hyatt.

They answered any question and/or concern I had with no problem. These are the new generation. You treat them with respect and they will reflect that right back. If you come at then with some nonsense or disrespect…you just might get that back in return haha.  I would say it took maybe a week to get my $150 for the incidentals. So if you need that back during your actual trip. I would advise you to pay in cash. And then you should be able to get that right back after they look at the room. Safe travel guys.

The ad stated that the hotel has a ""city view"".  Since then, the mention of ""city view"" has been removed from the ad. What we received in return was a house with a second floor walk-up room (with no elevator) and no front desk. The entrance was through the kitchen of the house and the smell was horrible.  The so-called city view consisted of a 6-storey garage building that spanned the whole block across from the Guest House Paradiso.  The owner of this house spoke no English and, according to our taxi driver, she only spoke Italian which he happened to understand a bit.  When our taxi driver saw the area and the building condition, he strongly urged us not to stay there.  We took his advice and searched for a suitable hotel accommodation for which we had to pay USD 220.  We also had to pay the taxi driver additionally although he never asked for it.  The advertisement by Hotels.com was false and misleading.  Yet, hotels.com refuses to issue a refund for the amount of CAD 131.99.  Such refund was promised to us by Chris from Hotels.com over the phone in Miami. We never dealt directly with Guest House Paradiso.  Our only communication is with Hotels.com who wrongly advertised the amenities and the location. In addition, it is not a hotel but a house.  Hotels.com is responsible for the contents of their advertisement.   Hotels.com cannot just accept anybody's description of their accommodation.  Hotels.com have to verify it since they are ultimately responsible to their clients. It was false and misleading advertisement!  It is insulting to us to write ""as the property does not meet your expectation"".  Hotels.com lied in their advertisement of this property!!!  It is Hotels.com who should issue a refund of CAD 131.99 + USD 220 for our one-night stay at a hotel in Miami in compensation for the hardship that we endured in search of a suitable hotel in Miami.  After visiting Guest House Paradiso and being repulsed by it, my husband called Hotels.com and spoke to Chris who promised to send me an e-mail and issue a refund in the amount of CAD 131.99.  Chris did not send me an e-mail and did not issue a refund either. Again it was a lie!  DO NOT BOOK THIS PLACE! IT SHOULD BE PERMANENTLY CLOSED DOWN!…",14,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d12756513-Reviews-Guest_House_Paradiso-Miami_Florida.html

Aloft Miami - Brickell,hotels,"1001 SW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33130-4009","I had been here for a stay on a business trip just a few months back in March of 2023. This stay had convinced me actually that I wanted to stay again on a trip last weekend with my daughter on our annual daddy-daughter back to school shopping trip (July 2023), and I was disappointed.    In March when there on business there was a decent warm breakfast each morning that was well stocked for what it was.  There was nothing this past visit and the room that they set it up in was constantly half blocked off to even enter by a line control type barrier.  Also, on the previous trip the hotel advertises this happy hour of sorts in the lobby where there are some small bites and a little gathering that is shown based on the posters in the elevators to run from 4pm to 11pm I believe.  In March, it was a nice added touch. This trip it was non-existent despite the signs still being posted advertising it.  Also, despite no smoking signs throughout the floors, there was a very strong smell of marijuana in the elevators and at least the hallway of the floor we stayed on - 8th floor.   This all in addition to some hassles at check-in because of a reservation confusion that I had called about weeks ahead and was assured was not an issue, but was when I checked in.  Because of one good experience and a great location for this hotel, I am not saying I would not stay here again, but I will look into other places when I come to Miami again.…",4.0,#67 of 155 hotels in Miami,"This is a basic hotel with no frills.

The breakfast they offer is frugal and on each of the three days that I ate here during different times, there were lots of people waiting for the food to be replenished. The offering is basic, indifferent and leaves us irritated. I complained to the front office gentleman ( not in the hotel attire for some reason) and he acted as though it was none of his business.

The location of this hotel was great for us and we’ve stayed in the Blue Lagoon area before. We really like the area, it’s safe and the view of the lagoon is very nice.  The hotel was clean and seemed fairly up to date. They had a small laundry facility (one washer, one dryer) which we made use of. You could purchase detergent and dryer sheets for $2.50/pack in the market. Cost of the washer and dryer was $1.50 each. Pretty standard. The dryer was crap though…it never fully dried out clothes after running it for 3 separate cycles of 45 minutes each on high.   Staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were spacious and clean. Beds were comfortable. Very nice pool that we enjoyed. They had a bar and small dining area. The prices were pretty high so we didn’t eat there. Overall we did enjoy our stay and would stay here again but I will share a few inconveniences we experienced.   Our first room (we started in one and had to be moved) was wheelchair accessible so it was much much larger than the standard suite rooms. We loved it BUT the AC in the sleeping area (most standard rooms only have one air conditioner unit but because this room with so much larger it had two, one in the sleeping area and one in the living room area) was not cooling well. So we let the front desk know and they immediately sent a maintenance person up. He checked and said yes there was an issue and that we would have to switch rooms because they would need to replace that air conditioner unit. This was fine and not a problem. However, we got moved to a much smaller standard room. Again, totally fine since that’s the room we booked anyway but was a bit of a hassle having to move after having unpacked all of our things.   Our room keys would stop working about every 1-2 days. This became a huge inconvenience and a hassle because we would get to the room and find our keys not working and have to go back down to the desk multiple times throughout our stay.  If you order from the dining area, know that they automatically add 18% gratuity even if it’s just one person ordering. My son wanted a waffle with just syrup, that cost $15 but then I had to pay $19 because of the gratuity. That was way too high for a waffle and I ordered it to go so there was no need for gratuity but I was forced to pay it.   The hallways on all the upper floors where the rooms are were unbearably hot as if they didn’t have AC in the hallways for  some reason. And in July during the hottest July on record around the world, this was not good.   The lighting in the rooms was adequate but it would have been nicer to have a little more light in the sleeping area of the room. There was only one small lamp in that area and it’s a large area so it didn’t light much.   A few small complaints but really we did enjoy this hotel and I would recommend it and would stay again.…",850,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d4451262-Reviews-Cambria_Hotel_Miami_Airport_Blue_Lagoon-Miami_Florida.html

The entrance & lobby area are lovely and modern but the rest of the hotel really isn’t up-scale.   The website mentions on-site dining but apparently that’s closed and has been for some time.   The room is pretty standard and we definitely weren’t wowed.   We had a diagonal view of the bay which is lovely but the balcony is shared (with a divider between) and wasn’t big enough to accommodate more than one person or one chair.   The bed and pillows weren’t great and could use updating.  The room itself was comfortable and spacious enough for the two of us in the limited time we spent here this week.  The AC worked well which is a must in Miami in summer and our room on the 9th floor was mostly quiet.    The bathroom was clean enough but severely needs a  thorough makeover. It’s quite dated and well-worn.  The shampoo & body wash dispensers were gross with multi-colored build-up.  However, as someone who needs a lot of space for products and tools in the bathroom, I wasn’t disappointed by the amount of counterspace & storage in the bathroom.     Front desk staff were pretty much indifferent from the time we checked in and throughout the next several days. Barely made eye contact or said anything, definitely not a “thank you” to be found.   The big plus of this hotel, apart from the view, is the location. There are so many options within walking distance that you really don’t even need a car during your stay.    Would we return?  Probably not. There must be more upscale accommodations in the area at this price point.…",1740,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d226187-Reviews-Hotel_Arya_BW_Premier_Collection-Miami_Florida.html

Upon arrival, we were told that the hotel was sold out. The front desk manager said that they had tried to contact us, but this was absolutely false - there was no email, voice mail, text, or anything, not to mention there was zero mention of it when WE called THEM several hours earlier. The manager was cold and unapologetic. We were not even offered transportation to the other hotel we then had to travel to and had to cover the costs ourselves. The manager promised that at the next hotel we wouldn't even have to put down a credit card for our stay for incidentals, but since we weren't given a letter or any documentation from the manager, we still had to put down a credit card at the other hotel, AND the card was charged for the stay (to which I don't blame the new hotel, since AC should have handled this). The new hotel we stayed at was much more sympathetic to our issue, and even offered us free drink vouchers, even though it wasn't their fault at all - much more than was offered by the hotel. Had there been any kind of notice or communication, or even just a sincere apology around the issue, we wouldn't have been so upset, because I get it, things happen - but the handling of this oversight was so poor, I'll never book with Marriot again.…",57,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d23610533-Reviews-AC_Hotel_by_Marriott_Miami_Brickell-Miami_Florida.html

Thankfully, there is a Cafe Boulud located in the hotel so we went there for brunch since breakfast was over.

If you are worried about safety they have a security guard on the premises 24hrs a day so any time you are coming in or out you will see them. The security was extremely helpful in ensuring we could get in and out the parking garage without issues, this is because our room key wouldn't scan us in or out.

We had booked this hotel based on previous reviews, however we had a terrible experience. When we arrived, the front desk asked if we would be using the pull-out bed and if we needed bedding for it. My husband and I were travelling with our two young children, so I said yes. They said it would be delivered to the room. After checking in, we got our bags from the car, and went to the room and there was a stack of sheets on the countertop for the pull out bed. It was very late at night, as we had driven in to Miami from Orlando after work, and our kids were tired. The first thing I did was go to pull out the pull-out bed from the couch. As I went to pull it out, I noticed black mold on the bottom of the mattress. This is a big issue, as our family suffered mold exposure in our previous home, and my husband is still recovering from debilitating illness due to mold. He cannot be exposed to further mold or it aggravates his condition. I went to the counter to move the sheets, and they were very clearly wet (not just a little damp, but legitimately wet as if they had been taken out of the dryer a quarter of the way through the drying cycle).    As a note, the Guild hotel is less of a hotel and more of a service to rent out furnished rooms in an apartment building. This would be fine, except it seems to be lacking in terms of service which you would expect from an actual ""4 star hotel"" as is advertised. This impacted the communication we have received.  I immediately sent an email to the Guild hotel about the situation. I never received a response. My husband went to the front desk and explained to the manager that we could not stay in a hotel that has visible signs of mold. The manager said that we would be issued a refund for the pre-paid rooms. We left and had to book another hotel last minute, which was less than ideal since it was almost midnight and we have young kids. If they had given us our refund immediately, I would have left it at that, but it has been over a month and a half and we have not received a refund or communication concerning this issue. I have tried calling the Guild multiple times. No one answers and there is no voicemail, only a message saying to call them back or text them. I sent them a text and have not received a response. I am hoping that they follow through on what their manager told us and provide us a refund as we had to pay for a different hotel, but at this time I would not recommend that anyone stay at the Guild Miami, as there seems to be poor communication and business practices.…",159,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d15145593-Reviews-The_Guild_Downtown_X_Miami-Miami_Florida.html

From the moment we arrived we had an issue. We had 3 large suitcases  and a lot of small stuff to carry and asked the valet for a bellhop cart and everyone seemed so lost and not interested to work. No one could help us, then proceeded to tell us that the valet is 48.00 per day!! All this time we’re taking everything out and they are just staring at us, not offering to help or anything. Which is fine but then don’t expect a tip because you couldn’t even go look for a cart to put my bags in. I had to make multiple trips to the garage to get our stuff. Next, they charge you a “ destination fee of 25 per person per day” this isn’t even a resort why are you charging a destination fee not to mention, they wanted us to use to it at the bar and it had to be used the day of if not you lose the credit. So it was basically paying $25 per person to buy alcohol? What if I don’t drink? Why do I need to pay. Then when I asked they wouldn’t apply the credit to breakfast, the market, or valet so what can I use the credit on? Only alcohol and I’m pregnant so what do I do? Order waters at the bar? .. it doesn’t make any sense? We booked through AMEX, and were not told of any additional fees. It’s a robbery. Do not stay here I do not recommend, we often stay at Marriott hotels and this does not live up to their standards. Please do not stay here. It’s bad customer service, the front desk isn’t nice and once again the 25$ credit fee for alcohol sounds more like a way for them to get some numbers on their books.

LYX Suites in Coconut Grove,condos,"2655 S Bayshore Dr, Miami, FL 33133-5446",Cancela tu reaerva sin razon despues de cobrarla y no quieren reintegrar el dinero .Me paso y por suerte Booking respondido devolviendo  mi dinero 3 meses después . No entiendo que ganan pero veo que es normal para todos los que han reservado ahi ,1.0,#28 of 28 condos in Miami,"This is not a hotel or lodging establishment equipped to offer travelers  typical services. It's not even on par with an Airbnb. It's an apartment building. I've never experienced a booking.com reservation like this. Here are some key pieces of advice before booking this location.   First, let's talk about the beyond annoying pre-arrival process. One star for the amount of paperwork required for completion BEFORE check-in. Most inconvenient and time-consuming lodging reservation process in my twenty years of adult traveling. The morning of my reservation--while flying across country to my destination--I received several emails from LXY suites asking me to fill out a docu sign form and to send copies of my photo ID and credit card BEFORE check-in for security purposes. The booking.com page does not mention this; it's mentioned at the bottom of the confirmation email received, which I did not fully read. No instructions whatsoever on how to send the credit card and photo ID copies, but the real question is this: Why do they need any of this information in advance? The docusign form requires you to type in your credit card information and confirm that you are willing to accept a $250 additional deposit, which will be for refunded to you in two weeks as long as there are no issues. Again, didn't see this listed at booking.com--again, it was at the bottom of the confirmation email. I tried to call the front desk periodically over four hours. No one ever answered. I left a voicemail message and no one called me back. I called booking.com to complain, and they couldn't get anyone to pick up either.  Surprise, surprise. I never received my deposit refund, which was supposed to arrive within 10 to 15 days. After 27 days, I emailed LXY booking to ask about the status. No one responded, but I received an auto-email receipt for the refund within a couple hours.   Second, arrival and appearance of the building. I lived in this neighborhood twenty years ago and remember this building well. It's an old high-rise called Bayshore Grove on Bayshore across from the marina. There are several for lease signs in front of the building and still plastic construction sheets covering portions of the lobby. I'm not sure what the story is, but it looks like an old building that has just been renovated, and they are trying to see if they can make some money doing super-short-term rentals, but they're not set up to offer the services of a two-night tourist stay. There was a security guard on site who obviously isn't answering the front desk phone number that I've been calling for three hours. He was very nice and helped me check in. He gave me a key card to use to get into the gate, but it did not work. He came out and tried to use his gate card and my card and could only periodically get his card to work. The next day, a different security guard told me that the reason why that card didn't work is because the unit I stayed and has a different parking garage entrance to the property. That parking entrance is an unmarked driveway around the block. He tried to give me verbal instructions of how to find it. I convinced him to let me park in the same area behind the building where I parked the night before. He says that each parking spot is designated, so he had to go see which one he could let me use. The previous guard mentioned none of this. Also, no one gave me the wifi network or password. There are more than ten listed, all with funny names. Luckily, the Courtyard Marriott next door had a strong enough signal for me to use theirs.   Lastly, the apartment. Spacious and modern with a lovely balcony. Partial view of the bay across street and past marina. Totally remodeled but still has popcorn ceilings and floors are laminate. The whole apartment smelled funny. Like glue -- maybe the new flooring? It wasn't as noticeable after being there a few hours. Door frame molding was old and closet doors didn't match. The bathroom was equipped with toiletries and a brand new hairdryer, but the room only had one bath towel, and it was hidden in the master closet. Six pillows in the bedroom but only one towel? I've never stayed anywhere in my life and only gave you one bath towel. Appliances were brand new/never been used; all paperwork still inside. The worst part--the king bed felt like a board. I love firm mattresses but this was almost like sleeping on plywood. There are softer beds in prisons. Front door only has one flip lock--no key locks or handle locks from the inside. The electrical outlet on the right side of the bed didn't work, the only electrical outlet in the bathroom didn't work and the water coming out of the bathroom sink and shower smelled like rotten eggs. Luckily there was a big mirror in the entryway with a working electrical outlet so I could dry my hair. Learned the hard way that you have to have the light switch by the front door turned on for the wall electrical outlets to work, so my computer never charged. Toilet had intermittent flushing issues. It fast became a lipstick-on-a-pig situation. Even if the apartment is in a great location and remodeled with nice modern decor across the street from the bay, once you factor in the additional fees, headaches, paperwork and check-in experience of staying in a residential building, it just didn't make the small amount savings worth the hassle in my opinion. I should get a discount for being their guinea pig.…",10,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d12193357-Reviews-LYX_Suites_in_Coconut_Grove-Miami_Florida.html

Aloft Miami - Brickell,hotels,"1001 SW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33130-4009","I had been here for a stay on a business trip just a few months back in March of 2023. This stay had convinced me actually that I wanted to stay again on a trip last weekend with my daughter on our annual daddy-daughter back to school shopping trip (July 2023), and I was disappointed.    In March when there on business there was a decent warm breakfast each morning that was well stocked for what it was.  There was nothing this past visit and the room that they set it up in was constantly half blocked off to even enter by a line control type barrier.  Also, on the previous trip the hotel advertises this happy hour of sorts in the lobby where there are some small bites and a little gathering that is shown based on the posters in the elevators to run from 4pm to 11pm I believe.  In March, it was a nice added touch. This trip it was non-existent despite the signs still being posted advertising it.  Also, despite no smoking signs throughout the floors, there was a very strong smell of marijuana in the elevators and at least the hallway of the floor we stayed on - 8th floor.   This all in addition to some hassles at check-in because of a reservation confusion that I had called about weeks ahead and was assured was not an issue, but was when I checked in.  Because of one good experience and a great location for this hotel, I am not saying I would not stay here again, but I will look into other places when I come to Miami again.…",4.0,#67 of 155 hotels in Miami,"Was upgraded to “suite”.

I started photographing everything. I made a movie of the room on entry so could prove all the internal damages to the room already existed. In the end management didn't give me my deposit back on checkout! Just how the reviews said they wouldn't! I demanded that they give it back to me before I leave the building and wanted a receipt to show it. They said I couldn't go check the room with the staff and had to wait 20 min for them to give me my deposit back. Knowing how it works I stayed until they complied. I have never had such a threatening experience with a hotel staff or cost structure. I am hoping this is an outlier with Wyndham and request that Wyndham correct the situation with this rogue hotel that is so hurting their brand. Would anyone stay a second time with a scam going on?

Cabins at Oleta River State Park,campgrounds,"Oleta River State Park, Miami, FL 33160-4460",We stayed Mon-Thr just before Thanksgiving and had a great time. I will share some tips that I wish I had before going.  Plan on cleaning the cabins a little before settling in. There is some level of cleaning done but if you are a clean person you will probably want to do more. There are no brooms or anything in the cabins so bring your own if necessary.  They are strict about not letting you into the cabin much before 4:00 pm even if the cabin has been unoccupied for a week. They did let a member of our group check in at 3:15 and get access to the cabin which was a surprise. We had arrived a little after lunch and were told to come back at 4:00.  There is nowhere to set anything in the bathroom / shower area. There are a couple of hooks and that's it. There are no benches or anything. You have to be creative with your stuff. It's also tricky because you are likely trying to touch as little as possible during COVID times. Other then that the bathrooms are pretty clean and were never crowded when we visited.  Each cabin has both a grill and a fire pit which has a grill that can be moved in or out. I would recommend buying your firewood from the grocery store ($6/bundle). They sell wood in the park as well but it may be from fallen trees and seems to burn faster then the hardwood from the store (Publix). We enjoyed the grills and the fire pits.  There are lots of mosquitos and no see ums particularly at dusk and dawn. Bring spray.  There is a kayak put in very close to the cabins if you bring your own kayaks. We had a great time and found a variety of conditions. There is interior mangrove paddling that is very calm regardless of the winds. There are other areas that can be quite challenging in heavy winds. We had fun on our paddle.  There are a lot of mountain bike trails. The signs say they require helmets. There is also some casual bike riding in the park.  We had raccoons (we think) open up out cooler and take a lot of food. I would suggest bringing your cooler into the cabin or securing it well. We lost a lot of good food at night to the little bandits. There are stores within a couple of miles from the park if needed.   One of the days we did an excursion to Calle Ocho or Little Havana. We enjoyed it and the food was very reasonably priced. There is a  lot of Cuban Heritage to experience. We also visited Wynwood Walls which is a lot of nice murals in a somewhat sketch area. It's fine to drive around but everyone may not want to walk around there at night. It also seems like a decent size area to walk. You could probably walk a few miles to see all of the murals on multiple streets. South Beach is also close by and is an interesting place to experience.…,3.5,#3 of 3 campgrounds in Miami,"It was cool and all but got a bit pricy when renting bikes for a couple of hours. I recommend bringing your own equipment for pretty much anything. Also, make sure to bring snacks and water they are also costly and with the heat you will get hungry. Overall good experience.

WiFi and breakfast are included in your stay as well as access to our outdoor pool and fitness center.",3.5,#91 of 155 hotels in Miami,"PROS: Stayed on a business trip and it was great. It is located within the business district so my workshop was less than five minutes away. Not only that, but restaurants, takeaways, pharmacies, and department stores were nearby (within 5-15 minutes)- with Panda Express, Chipotle, and Starbucks being in the same lot. Parking was free and it wasn't difficult finding a spot.   The rooms were spacious and clean. I loved the interior designed (except for one part stated below). My room (odd numbered) had a beautiful view of the lake and it was nice seeing people canoe. I especially liked the bathroom - its layout and built-in products. Breakfast was included and it was tasty. Persons could dine-in or take something to go. It also turns into a restaurant with happy hour in the afternoon. I also liked that in the lobby they had items for sale. Customer and cleaning services were great as well. Late checkout was also available upon request and is based on availability. I also appreciated the security measure such as using your room key to operate the elevator.   CONS: My bed was too hard and lumpy for me but my coworkers stated that theirs were great. There are no microwaves in the room, only the lobby, and my fridge did not cool nor does it have a freezer section. One of my coworkers also stated that hers did not cool much. There is no closet - you had to hang your clothes on the designed pipe or wall rack. This caused me to wake up startled at times thinking someone was standing in the room (lol). For long-term customers, there are no drawers, therefore, you will have to live out of your suitcase. This was not an issue for me as my stay was only four nights, however, for others, it may be so. Also I heard weird noises that are more pronounced at night. At first, I thought someone was trying to get into my room but I later deduced that it may be the building's plumbing. I am a light sleeper, thus, this also startled me at times and woke me out of my sleep.   OVERALL: I would recommend this hotel to others and would stay here if I was to visit the city on vacation or business again. It was ideally located and great inside. …",72,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d23633036-Reviews-Tru_By_Hilton_Miami_Airport_South_Blue_Lagoon_Fl-Miami_Florida.html

We tried to confirm the late check-out with the manager the day before our leaving but it was explained that only the manager on her tomorrow shift will be able to give the exact information, so we didn't expect any nonsense.

Got to my room it was sprayed with Lysol... must have been the whole can. Rooms are small bed was comfortable sheet was clean ... room was not as clean as it could have been had popcorn under my bed room was dusty and they had roaches.... I did advised the owner she stated when it rains they come in... 2nd night room smelled like BBQ because our room was right on the side of a park where there was chickens and alot of home less people cooking on a grill which made my clothes also smell. Microwave didn't work fridge was clean and worked. Shower curtain liner was cheap looking ... the concept is great just needs to work on better customer service and cleaner the rooms ...the have free breakfast but the food was old I did ask about fresh fruit for 2 days .. front desk lady stated owner didn't get time to go to the store there was a microwave in that little break area but it also was old and dirty.

Over all I would not stay there again ...unless I absolutely had to. Parking is offering on the side of the building. You get a paper pass to put in window. This could really be a beautiful place to experience if the owner.. well it's 3 women owners buy the one shorter one who was there had better people skills. And treated her employees better. To offer breakfast and not have fresh items to eat was confusing to me .. just don't offer anything if the food is rotten. And purchase a new microwave, it's old rusty and dirty.

Aloft Miami - Brickell,hotels,"1001 SW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33130-4009","I had been here for a stay on a business trip just a few months back in March of 2023. This stay had convinced me actually that I wanted to stay again on a trip last weekend with my daughter on our annual daddy-daughter back to school shopping trip (July 2023), and I was disappointed.    In March when there on business there was a decent warm breakfast each morning that was well stocked for what it was.  There was nothing this past visit and the room that they set it up in was constantly half blocked off to even enter by a line control type barrier.  Also, on the previous trip the hotel advertises this happy hour of sorts in the lobby where there are some small bites and a little gathering that is shown based on the posters in the elevators to run from 4pm to 11pm I believe.  In March, it was a nice added touch. This trip it was non-existent despite the signs still being posted advertising it.  Also, despite no smoking signs throughout the floors, there was a very strong smell of marijuana in the elevators and at least the hallway of the floor we stayed on - 8th floor.   This all in addition to some hassles at check-in because of a reservation confusion that I had called about weeks ahead and was assured was not an issue, but was when I checked in.  Because of one good experience and a great location for this hotel, I am not saying I would not stay here again, but I will look into other places when I come to Miami again.…",4.0,#67 of 155 hotels in Miami, A very informal hotel which is definitely overpriced for the services.

I spent $6,500 and that didn’t even include breakfast which cost me $24.40 per day which was microwaved with rubber eggs and very average (slow) coffee.  The fact that things are broken in the hotel, like the entry key after 12 midnight, which meant I had to bang on the door for 10 minutes or the equipment in the gym, means this place is really shabby and not up to the standards they charge the extortionate prices for.  However, the thing that grinds my gears the most is the slack cleaning services.  They only clean rooms once every three days and have this system that encourages residents to not have their rooms cleaned which reduces the hours the (Spanish speaking) cleaners get paid.  Meanwhile, they give a small portion of those savings to charity and somehow manage to claim the moral high ground of how they are such a fantastic company, while clearly making massive additional revenues from bad service and treating their staff poorly.  Every time I tried to use the cleaning service out of the allocated 3 x days, there was always some ridiculous issue.  I come to Miami every few months and will never come to this hotel ever again as the rooms are tiny, the prices are crazy and the staff are seriously lack lustre.…",17,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d24958189-Reviews-CitizenM_Miami_Worldcenter-Miami_Florida.html

She didn't even care to hear that my wife and I weren't talking loud. Even though I do believe it isn't against the law to talk to my wife. After I said I wasn't talking loud she then threatens to kick us out. Completely takes their side without even giving me a chance to speak. If I wasn't homeless from a hurricane I would leave.

Cabins at Oleta River State Park,campgrounds,"Oleta River State Park, Miami, FL 33160-4460",We stayed Mon-Thr just before Thanksgiving and had a great time. I will share some tips that I wish I had before going.  Plan on cleaning the cabins a little before settling in. There is some level of cleaning done but if you are a clean person you will probably want to do more. There are no brooms or anything in the cabins so bring your own if necessary.  They are strict about not letting you into the cabin much before 4:00 pm even if the cabin has been unoccupied for a week. They did let a member of our group check in at 3:15 and get access to the cabin which was a surprise. We had arrived a little after lunch and were told to come back at 4:00.  There is nowhere to set anything in the bathroom / shower area. There are a couple of hooks and that's it. There are no benches or anything. You have to be creative with your stuff. It's also tricky because you are likely trying to touch as little as possible during COVID times. Other then that the bathrooms are pretty clean and were never crowded when we visited.  Each cabin has both a grill and a fire pit which has a grill that can be moved in or out. I would recommend buying your firewood from the grocery store ($6/bundle). They sell wood in the park as well but it may be from fallen trees and seems to burn faster then the hardwood from the store (Publix). We enjoyed the grills and the fire pits.  There are lots of mosquitos and no see ums particularly at dusk and dawn. Bring spray.  There is a kayak put in very close to the cabins if you bring your own kayaks. We had a great time and found a variety of conditions. There is interior mangrove paddling that is very calm regardless of the winds. There are other areas that can be quite challenging in heavy winds. We had fun on our paddle.  There are a lot of mountain bike trails. The signs say they require helmets. There is also some casual bike riding in the park.  We had raccoons (we think) open up out cooler and take a lot of food. I would suggest bringing your cooler into the cabin or securing it well. We lost a lot of good food at night to the little bandits. There are stores within a couple of miles from the park if needed.   One of the days we did an excursion to Calle Ocho or Little Havana. We enjoyed it and the food was very reasonably priced. There is a  lot of Cuban Heritage to experience. We also visited Wynwood Walls which is a lot of nice murals in a somewhat sketch area. It's fine to drive around but everyone may not want to walk around there at night. It also seems like a decent size area to walk. You could probably walk a few miles to see all of the murals on multiple streets. South Beach is also close by and is an interesting place to experience.…,3.5,#3 of 3 campgrounds in Miami,"I found out about this place from a fellow camper down in the Keys last year. Decided to give it a try on our way to Key west for New Years. We were there from December 23 to December 26. As we approached the Campground on route we were surprised by the huge amount of Christmas traffic and activity on the roads. When we turned into the campground it was very serene and soothing.we happened to get the last cabin available, between the two campground host's RVs and right next to the bathrooms. It is the handicap one, I guess because of it's proximity to the bathrooms. It was very nice and very quiet. There was a little Christmas partying going on in other cabins but fine where we were, the cabins are rustic and clean. The windows don't open, from age, but the a/c worked fine. There were a couple of plugs, and a ceiling light. We had our propane stove and cooked out on the porch. The full size bed was comfortable but had a rubber cover so bring a mattress pad. There only 12 cabins in this place, no tent sites, but it is very active for day trippers. We enjoyed our trips to south beach and Little Havana, and to the numerous other smaller Malls nearby. We are planning a return trip for Thanksgiving-same cabin!…",15,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d3717779-Reviews-Cabins_at_Oleta_River_State_Park-Miami_Florida.html

She was horribly rude and dismissive.  I booked this hotel on Hotwire.  Both Hotwire and the Hotels website states that there is a free airport shuttle.  When I called them to come pick us up, the front desk lady told us the shuttle ends at 10:30pm.  We were there at 10:45pm.  So, we booked a $27 Uber.  On the way to the hotel I found that the shuttle runs until midnight on Saturday.  So, the lady flat out lied to me.  When I arrived, she changed her story and said that they couldn’t find a driver.  Totally different story (not sure if the 2nd excuse was valid), but regardless, I thought the hotel should pay my Uber.  The hotel said that I had to get a refund from Hotwire.  I called Hotwire and they said “We have no mechanism to issue refunds”.  So, I went back to the desk to let them know and to also purchase a couple beers.  She just got pissed and rudely shooed me away, saying “just keep the beers, we’re even”.  Sorry, but the rudeness I experienced and the $27 I needlessly spent on an Uber, don’t even come close to me being “even”.  Great way to start our vacation.  I’ve never been so rudely talked to by a hotel employee… NEVER… And we travel a lot more than most people.  Also, to the guy who posted a review right before me, the Sonese Eccleston you refer to is the person I had troubles with.  She’s the front desk person, and she’s not the owner.  She is an assistant manager.  I tried to upload her business card showing she’s asst. mgr., but the photo won’t upload.  Getting on a cruise ship tomorrow.

Earlier this month, I was part of a group of 3 and we stayed in Tower 2, suite 2402. The suite was nice and clean. I stayed in the room without the ensuite. The room was good sized with a queen/double bed.. it included a desk and decent closet. The bathroom was large, but not particularly modern. Overall, it was a good stay.   This most recent trip, 31 Oct - 4 Nov, we stayed in Tower 1, suite 1701. This building seemed smaller but the suite appeared much bigger! I stayed in the room with the ensuite and it was HUGE. The king sized bed was so comfy. Even though the duvet was covered well, when part of the sheet came off I saw there was a small stain :-( The TV in the room was a nice touch, but something was wrong with the display and despite having a similar Samsung model at home, I could not figure out how to take it off. I absolutely loved having a balcony attached to my room but the view was fabulous from all the balconies. Everything was clean and there were lots of nice touches like detergent by the washing machine. We took Uber/Lyft everywhere - they were always like 2-3 minutes away and really affordable. The 24 hr Walgreens and Publix are in walking distance, along with a gas station. I walked to the Walgreens many times and very late at night, always felt safe.   My favorite part of Stay Alfred is the check in/out system. They provide you with a code to enter the building [Tower 2] and then very easy to understand instructions to use a key cafe where you receive the fob and access card that allows you to enter both buildings and your suite. All of this is clearly outlined in the emails sent prior to your arrival with specific details provided about 48 hours before check-in. During our stay we never needed to contact anyone so I did not miss a front desk. They do have a 24 hr customer service number and live chat if you do have questions.  I was never a fan of hotels and have been opting for AirBnBs during all my trips for the last few years. Now I am really looking forward to using Stay Alfred on all my future trips.…",832,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d1773875-Reviews-Stay_Alfred_Brickell-Miami_Florida.html

For over $300/night you do expect it it be clean and accommodating and it was. I give this hotel 2 out of 5 stars completely based on the fact it’s not family friendly in my opinion. I have an 11yr old and a 6yr old that absolutely love to swim. The pool area plays music over a stereo system, very vulgar music, with A LOT of cuss words. Not simple ones either. The “F” word was dropped multiple times. We stayed on for 1 more song that also had several different “bad” words. Though not completely in the hotels control, there were also several groups of rather intoxicated guests who were literally on top of each other making out on this same pool deck. All of this in the matter of a 20 min span. We left and my children were not able to enjoy that accommodation any further.  I would also like to add that you should definitely be sure to not leave ANYTHING behind. Albert, who is the head of security or was filling in for the head of security, will treat you like a criminal over a $25 flat iron. We called the hotel on Saturday to confirm it was left behind fully expecting it would be waiting for us on Monday when we returned. Wrong. We waited 35 minutes for Albert to appear with the flat iron as we were told he was the only person with keys to the supposed room it was located in. Once it was brought to the desk he spoke to my husband completely disrespectful and demanded pictures of my flatiron, proof of our stay and my husbands passport!

Cabins at Oleta River State Park,campgrounds,"Oleta River State Park, Miami, FL 33160-4460",We stayed Mon-Thr just before Thanksgiving and had a great time. I will share some tips that I wish I had before going.  Plan on cleaning the cabins a little before settling in. There is some level of cleaning done but if you are a clean person you will probably want to do more. There are no brooms or anything in the cabins so bring your own if necessary.  They are strict about not letting you into the cabin much before 4:00 pm even if the cabin has been unoccupied for a week. They did let a member of our group check in at 3:15 and get access to the cabin which was a surprise. We had arrived a little after lunch and were told to come back at 4:00.  There is nowhere to set anything in the bathroom / shower area. There are a couple of hooks and that's it. There are no benches or anything. You have to be creative with your stuff. It's also tricky because you are likely trying to touch as little as possible during COVID times. Other then that the bathrooms are pretty clean and were never crowded when we visited.  Each cabin has both a grill and a fire pit which has a grill that can be moved in or out. I would recommend buying your firewood from the grocery store ($6/bundle). They sell wood in the park as well but it may be from fallen trees and seems to burn faster then the hardwood from the store (Publix). We enjoyed the grills and the fire pits.  There are lots of mosquitos and no see ums particularly at dusk and dawn. Bring spray.  There is a kayak put in very close to the cabins if you bring your own kayaks. We had a great time and found a variety of conditions. There is interior mangrove paddling that is very calm regardless of the winds. There are other areas that can be quite challenging in heavy winds. We had fun on our paddle.  There are a lot of mountain bike trails. The signs say they require helmets. There is also some casual bike riding in the park.  We had raccoons (we think) open up out cooler and take a lot of food. I would suggest bringing your cooler into the cabin or securing it well. We lost a lot of good food at night to the little bandits. There are stores within a couple of miles from the park if needed.   One of the days we did an excursion to Calle Ocho or Little Havana. We enjoyed it and the food was very reasonably priced. There is a  lot of Cuban Heritage to experience. We also visited Wynwood Walls which is a lot of nice murals in a somewhat sketch area. It's fine to drive around but everyone may not want to walk around there at night. It also seems like a decent size area to walk. You could probably walk a few miles to see all of the murals on multiple streets. South Beach is also close by and is an interesting place to experience.…,3.5,#3 of 3 campgrounds in Miami,"The park is great regarding what is offers – biking trails, beach, canoeing. The nature is beautiful and the park is well-kept. We have been camping there annually for quite a few years, however it seems that park rangers are paying less and less attention to campside park rules. We have seen dogs running around, and the major problem is the music that is played through amplifiers.  Last year, 2017  we camped in May, and there was a big group of people that were occupying most of campside cabins. In addition, they were joined by a number of other friends who came to party. Amplifier music, loud singing drunken voices – it took me three calls finally for the park ranger to come down, and have them silencing the music.  It seems that there is a park ranger trailer on the site, but he is not much observant of what is happening.  If you go to the beach, you may have a similar experience - groups with deafening amplifier music that makes cacophony, and the park rangers do nothing about it.…",15,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d3717779-Reviews-Cabins_at_Oleta_River_State_Park-Miami_Florida.html

Aloft Miami - Brickell,hotels,"1001 SW 2nd Ave, Miami, FL 33130-4009","I had been here for a stay on a business trip just a few months back in March of 2023. This stay had convinced me actually that I wanted to stay again on a trip last weekend with my daughter on our annual daddy-daughter back to school shopping trip (July 2023), and I was disappointed.    In March when there on business there was a decent warm breakfast each morning that was well stocked for what it was.  There was nothing this past visit and the room that they set it up in was constantly half blocked off to even enter by a line control type barrier.  Also, on the previous trip the hotel advertises this happy hour of sorts in the lobby where there are some small bites and a little gathering that is shown based on the posters in the elevators to run from 4pm to 11pm I believe.  In March, it was a nice added touch. This trip it was non-existent despite the signs still being posted advertising it.  Also, despite no smoking signs throughout the floors, there was a very strong smell of marijuana in the elevators and at least the hallway of the floor we stayed on - 8th floor.   This all in addition to some hassles at check-in because of a reservation confusion that I had called about weeks ahead and was assured was not an issue, but was when I checked in.  Because of one good experience and a great location for this hotel, I am not saying I would not stay here again, but I will look into other places when I come to Miami again.…",4.0,#67 of 155 hotels in Miami,"Not your typical Marriott property!

I woke up on my second morning in this hotel to wet carpet and traced the water to a leak coming from the ceiling next to the window.  There was visible black mold, water damage to the drywall, and water coming from the ceiling down the wall.  The curtains were also soaked and the track they were attached to was coming loose from the ceiling.  I immediately notified the front desk and told them I was leaving the hotel.  I had booked a 4-night stay and I found this after waking up after my second night in the hotel.  Rather than apologize and thank me for alerting him to the problem, the manager, Howard Otero, told me that he was charging me the first night I stayed at the hotel.  I asked him to view the damage with me in the room and that this did not look like a leak that occurred overnight but had likely been going on for some time given that the black mold was visible through the dry wall, the drywall damage and erosion was significant, there were dried as well as wet water streaks on the wall, and given the amount of water running down from the ceiling at the time I found the leak.  He refused to view the room with me or refund me for the cost of my stay.  A few minutes after leaving the hotel I saw that the invoice given to me only reflected the refund for the last night I stayed there and was not an invoice for my entire stay.  After calling him and speaking to him on the phone, asking for an invoice reflective of the stay and what charges he was holding me responsible for, and reiterating my position that I should not have been charged for any night in that room given the leak and mold, he sent me an invoice reflecting a one night charge and then hung up on me after he told me that the problem had already been fixed and I told him that I didn't believe that.  This was minutes after I left the hotel.  There is simply no way you can remove and replace damaged drywall, carpet, mold, furnishings, etc. and remediate the mold in minutes.   After my phone conversation with Mr. Otero, I immediately called my credit card company to dispute the one-night charge and found out from them that charges were pending from the hotel in the amount equal to the 4-night stay I had originally booked.   I felt like I was scammed, and that the hotel knew about the condition of the room and was putting guests in it anyway.  This appeared to be a leak that had been going on for some time and I only got to discover it after the water from the leak seeped far enough into the carpet for me to notice it when I walked over to the desk in the room.  I will never stay at this hotel again.  It was clear to me that they do not care about their guests or the condition of their rooms, and that they are ignoring building and safety codes meant to safeguard everyone's health and well-being.…",63,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d12831840-Reviews-Candlewood_Suites_Miami_Exec_Airport_Kendall_an_IHG_Hotel-Miami_Florida.html

You can walk to the marina and local bars. Price was low, probably as there was no bar/restaurant open by the pool.  It is closed.  So no breakfast.   Room was worn, TV sitting crooked and I had to kill a few roaches.  The worst part however was that the fire alarm in my room went off around 1:30AM two nights in a row. The first night the alarm went off, I went downstairs, (I was on the 21st floor), asked the receptionist what was going on, as it was only me down there.  He barely believed me.  Then he came up with a ladder, heard the incredibly loud noise and took it down.  Yesterday the alarm was back in the ceiling again. At 1:10 AM, it started howling again. Waking me up a second night.  I’m not a smoker, not vaping and no burning candles.  I didn’t even start the TV during my stay.    After getting startled two nights in a row, with little chance of going back to sleep, I was expecting some kind of personal compensation upon checking out. I just received the email.  Indeed, they comped $40 back to my company.  I was expecting something for me, I was the one not sleeping.  I normally do not stay in BW hotels.  This one has a good location and the price was great, so I wanted to try it.  I do not think I can ever sleep there again.  I do travel extensively since 30 years, all around the world.

It promotes itself to be a modern minimalist boutique hotel.  $275 for 1 night.  When you pay $275 you expect better quality.  This place was closer to a roadside motel than modern downtown hotel.  Cons:  No lamps in the room            Wifi super slow (like dial up) or non-existent.            TV sporadic reception.  Mostly fuzz.            AC (window based) didn't work. No freon.  And filthy.  Room was 80-82                     degrees, while the A/C was set to 64 for 5 hours.            Drain in shower not properly sealed.            Towel holder may have fallen off of wall.            Initial room didn't have city view.            Couldn't enjoy city view once sun came up since the AC didn't work.            Front desk staff lacks sympathy, empathy or desire to fix problems.            Front desk staff will blame you for short comings of facility - mostly                       because they offer no refunds.  But it's not like they have to                       offer a full refund.  She could have offered She could have                       offered to extend check out by 2 hours.  Or offer $30 or $50 for                       my trouble.  Or a $10 Starbuck's gift card.                         I used their facility.  I wouldn't want a full refund.  But sheesh!                         Act like you care that things didn't go well.   Or just give me a $5                      breakfast sandwich or something. The whole avoiding a refund                      doesn't have to be so drastic that no consideration is shown for                      the inconvenience.              Room service provided by another party was closed at 0900 on                       12/31/2021.  So no breakfast.            The A/C tech showed up at 0906 AM.  Didn't know how to fix the A/C.                          He cleaned the filter.  The unit itself still dirty.  And increased                        the fan speed.  That isn't how these things work.  Increasing the                        fan speed doesn't make the air any colder.             Another call to front desk.  This time I'm asking why she's so resistant.                          I'm asking about the background of the hotel.  Like does she or                        her parents own it?  Is that why she's so non-chalant?             At 0930 - She agrees to exchange the A/C unit.  0956 new unit works                        great.  Check out is at 1100.  But I needed that 1 hour of                        actually cold air.  Pros:  Location           Eclectic decor           City view           The only decent customer service was an attempt to find me someplace to eat once it was discovered that the second party room service didn't start until noon.  And after I badgered her, she had the A/C changed out.  No readings on this one.  But works a heck of a lot better than the last.             ------------------------------------- Narrative:  I arrived in the middle of the night after a very long day of international travel.  I made a reservation for a room with view.  The first room they put me in, Room 305, had a view of the side of the building of Miami-Dade College.   After a very frustrating travel schedule, I really wanted a room with a view to unwind.  I reluctantly asked to be moved.  Room 517 -  Great view.   However, the Wi-fi either wouldn't connect or moved so slowly when connected that I thought I was using dial up. I ended up paying extra to hotspot my phone rather than even attempt to use their Wifi.  The air conditioner didn't work.  It was basically a glorified fan.  The air was cool, but not cold.  At 0830 when I asked for the AC to be serviced, I was told that check-out was in 2 hours.  Meanwhile, the sun is blaring into the single pane windows.  I had to close the curtains to abate the heat.  Finally got the A/C unit exchanged at 0956.  The room was 82 degrees prior.  The girl at the front desk will find any way to spin any of your complaints or concerns to make it seem as if you're the problem.   Her voice and cadence is also weird.  It's like she's using an attempt to perky as a weapon.  She has no interest in actually assisting you.  Probably because they have an absolute ""no refund"" policy.  The customer service could use some help.  I thought the rooms were cute and eclectic.  They are very minimalist.  You can tell that they've tried to upgrade, but it seems unfinished.…",17,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d644417-Reviews-Miami_Sun_Hotel-Miami_Florida.html

Dunns Josephine Hotel,small hotels,"1028 NW 3rd Ave, Miami, FL 33136-3308","I wish my experience was as good as the others... got there early in the morning there was a drunk man out side who dropped chocolate in front of the door wich btw got on my shirt .. when I advised the staff .. they said ohhhh sorry about that .. it never came out...... asked about a day rate... none to offer was given a price paid it ... now while I am checking in the owner is calling the front desk lady demanding her to tell the drunk man and another man to leave ... front desk stated okay the other gentleman was actually helping she yells and says we dont need his help.... all while I am in  front of her...later was told that was not the right price.... staff didn't wait for me to come to the looby they came to my room. Got to my room it was sprayed with Lysol... must have been the whole can. Rooms are small bed was comfortable sheet was clean ... room was not as clean as it could have been had popcorn under my bed room was dusty and they had roaches.... I did advised the owner she stated when it rains they come in... 2nd night room smelled like BBQ because our room was right on the side of a park where there was chickens and alot of home less people cooking on a grill which made my clothes also smell. Microwave didn't work fridge was clean and worked. Shower curtain liner was cheap looking ... the concept is great just needs to work on better customer service and cleaner the rooms ...the have free breakfast but the food was old I did ask about fresh fruit for 2 days .. front desk lady stated owner didn't get time to go to the store there was a microwave in that little break area but it also was old and dirty. The front desk has a mirror so you can see behind the front desk... it was junky and dirty as can be... very shocked since it was 3 women who I saw working there. See pictures. Over all I would not stay there again ...unless I absolutely had to. Parking is offering on the side of the building. You get a paper pass to put in window. This could really be a beautiful place to experience if the owner.. well it's 3 women owners buy the one shorter one who was there had better people skills. And treated her employees better. To offer breakfast and not have fresh items to eat was confusing to me .. just don't offer anything if the food is rotten. And purchase a new microwave, it's old rusty and dirty.  Hire a professional painter and  cleaners. DONT have front desk cleaning rooms unless they have been trained to. And get the hotel under a pest control contract. Rain should not have anything to do with roaches coming in they are not water bugs...…",3.5,#1 of 5 small hotels in Miami,"I gave this hotel a 2/5 because the front desk attendants were very nice and the bed was pretty comfy, but other than that, this hotel is located in a very bad part of town. Homeless camp around the corner.  We did not leave the room, thank god it was only for one night, and thank god for Grubhub. The hotel also claims to have continental breakfast, but does not. The closet door was broken in our room, and the lighting in the room was very dark in hopes that people won’t see that it’s not very clean. The icing on the cake was the fire alarm going off at 1am. We were too tired to care and too scared to leave the room to go outside.

There are two downsides to this hotel:  Location and condition of rooms.   There are no stores (other than a mini mart gas station) nearby. There are restaurants, but they are some distance away. Plan on a walk on a very busy road.   The rooms are in desperate need of repair - mainly paint and new bathrooms.  The rooms do have an odor (other than the musty smell all Florida hotels have).

First, they charged me the entire amount up front, and I had to struggle with them to just charge me the deposit. In between the booking and our trip, the COVID situation exploded, and a travel advisory was issued to avoid all non-essential international travel out of the country (we live in Canada). Unfortunately, I was forced to cancel our trip. This was sufficiently ahead of my trip so as to make changes (which I did not WANT to make – who wouldn’t want to escape the Canadian winter for some lovely Miami sunshine?).   Despite this, the hotel maintained that they would charge us for the FULL STAY. “For the moment we are only waiving penalty fees for guests arriving from Europe, China and North Korea…..you will be charged 100%.” stated Ursala Morris, in an email, later reiterated by Andrea Salas. After asking them to reconsider in light of the explosive circumstances, they refused and indicated their intent to charge 100%.   Furthermore, they kept telling me I should get in touch with the website I booked through, that perhaps I could make changes through them. I had to continually remind them that I made my reservation directly with them, over the phone.   Between their initial incompetence charging me the entire amount as a deposit, and their eventual profiteering in the face of a national emergency, this organization is absolutely crooked.

I did not eat there, but the patrons that did loved their meals.  The room was clean and had nice amenities like a refrigerator and capsule coffee machine.  I needed caffeinated capsules as the capsules had not been refilled and I only had non-caffeinated.  They promptly fixed that and delivered some.  The bed was comfortable and the products in the bathroom area were lovely.  At times, I heard other visitors in the hallway.  So, the doors are not soundproof.  Luckily, it was not a party hotel like South Beach.  I can’t attest to the vicinity as I drove everywhere.  It’s not too far from Brickell City Centre.  However, I would not advise walking from there at night because the area is not quite as gentrified outside the 4 blocks of the City Centre.  To be fair, I would not advise walking during the day either because it’s just far enough that you may melt on the way there.  For reference, it’s about a half a mile away.  Once you get there, you will find an array of luxury stores, restaurants and a movie theater.  There is a pool at this hotel, but I did not use it as I was staying for work.

I live local and finally got a chance to stay in this hotel for an event at the arena.   This hotel is located above the JW Marriott Marquis and the lobby is on the 39th floor. The elevators require a key card to access that floor and I had to ask someone at the front desk for JW Marriott to get me up there. And I had to wait about 20 mins for someone to be available to ask me that.   Finally got up to the Hotel Beaux Arts lobby, the check is process was very nice and the lady was nice enough to walk me straight to my room and give me a little tour before getting settled, which was a nice touch.   The room itself is very beautifully designed and appointed. The was built in 2010 and it was way ahead of its time. However, it was starting to show its age and was lacking some maintenance. The Air conditioner in the living room area was extremely noisy. The AC in the bedroom was fine and I was only staying one night so I didn’t make a fuss about it. The shower head was leaking and spraying water onto the ceiling and had awful water pressure. The colorful touch faucets were cool but starting not work well because of their age.   I was surprised to discover the minibar was not stocked (they do advertise a Minibar) and the coffee maker was not working. This was pretty disappointing for a $600/night room. They used to have Bang & Olufsen sound systems in the rooms but those are long gone. Aside from the that, it was clean, and the bed was very comfortable.   The valet experience was the worst i have ever seen. Extremely understaffed and completely disorganized with people that don’t know what they’re doing. Each time, even requesting it ahead of time I still had to wait at least 20 mins for my car. The staff doesn’t direct the cars and it constantly gets backed up into the street because of the all the Uber drivers coming through there. I’m guessing the garage is somewhere not close because if the drawbridge was up it would take even longer. On checkout day I lost my claim tag, so I showed my ID to prove that my name matched what was on the tag and it took them like 10 mins to figure that out. That part was a disaster. My advice, don’t drive or park somewhere else on your own nearby.   A lot of the service issues I experienced seemed to be more with the JW Marriott staff rather than Hotel Beaux Arts itself. I’d be willing to give the hotel another stay but I don’t feel like I got what I paid for.

How can exact same apartment in Mark (the newer building next door, which is an upgraded version of Yacht Club) have asking price of $1,200 to $1,500 a month vs. $1,800 - $1,900 a month in Yacht Club? Or the corner units with asking price of $1,600 to $2,000 vs. $2,400 - $2,700 in Yacht Club. Not to mention “One Miami” the modern building for 40% less than Yacht Club. Take a close look at what Yacht Club offers compare to other buildings: 1). Dirty Carpet vs hardwood or marble floors. Why? Because they charge every resident for carpet replacement at the end of the lease but instead of replacing it, they just clean it. The old stains will appear within two weeks. 2). Cheapest appliances, kitchen counters, cabinets and bathrooms vs. modern appliances, granite kitchens counters, modern cabinets and marble bathrooms in newer buildings. 3). Yacht Club at Brickell is now managed by AIMCO, the company that specializes in real estate for low income families, just take a look at their web site to see for yourself. When building was sold by Oakwood to AIMCO several years ago, the residents began to move out. It got really bad for the past year and a half. The only part of the building that is being maintained is the lobby and the 10th floor (where the showroom is located). Broken glass, empty bottles and trash at the sundeck, swimming pool and hot tub, which most of the time is “out of service”. Dirty saunas that do not heat, broken gym and business center equipment just to name a few. Yacht Club is charging $800 pet fee, where does it go? Carpet at building hallways and service elevator smells disgusting at all times. Pets litter is all over the building and everywhere around the building. It appears like the only parts of building are being cleaned are where they show apartments to future tenants. In addition, building does not provide any type of security to their residents. One minimum wage security guard who is watching soap operas all night, while multiple apartments got robbed in 2007 / 2008, bikes and valuables from parked vehicles are getting stolen on a regular basis and multiple vehicles parked in garage were vandalized.

Got to my room it was sprayed with Lysol... must have been the whole can. Rooms are small bed was comfortable sheet was clean ... room was not as clean as it could have been had popcorn under my bed room was dusty and they had roaches.... I did advised the owner she stated when it rains they come in... 2nd night room smelled like BBQ because our room was right on the side of a park where there was chickens and alot of home less people cooking on a grill which made my clothes also smell. Microwave didn't work fridge was clean and worked. Shower curtain liner was cheap looking ... the concept is great just needs to work on better customer service and cleaner the rooms ...the have free breakfast but the food was old I did ask about fresh fruit for 2 days .. front desk lady stated owner didn't get time to go to the store there was a microwave in that little break area but it also was old and dirty. The front desk has a mirror so you can see behind the front desk... it was junky and dirty as can be... very shocked since it was 3 women who I saw working there. See pictures. Over all I would not stay there again ...unless I absolutely had to. Parking is offering on the side of the building. You get a paper pass to put in window. This could really be a beautiful place to experience if the owner.. well it's 3 women owners buy the one shorter one who was there had better people skills. And treated her employees better. To offer breakfast and not have fresh items to eat was confusing to me .. just don't offer anything if the food is rotten. And purchase a new microwave, it's old rusty and dirty.  Hire a professional painter and  cleaners. DONT have front desk cleaning rooms unless they have been trained to. And get the hotel under a pest control contract.

You have to valet park at extra cost - but pretty much all Miami hotels are like that if you're close to downtown.  within 10-15 minutes of Whole Foods and Publix and plenty of restaurants.  Pool isn't much, but that wasn't important to me.  I complained that the hot water wasn't working but that was my fault, turning the dial the wrong way and not patient enough when trying the opposite to let the water get hot!! It takes a few minutes, be patient.  Only ""miss"" was that a small device with outlets for power above the desk/table hadn't been cleaned for a while, but I didn't think a star subtraction was warranted because of the following:  the staff is great - they really have a great attitude, friendly, and accommodating.  This included the Valet staff - I never called ahead and they were really efficient at getting the car timely - and always with a smile on their faces.

Relax by the outdoor pool or sample great food in Urbano Restaurant & Bar.",4.0,#80 of 155 hotels in Miami,"This is long, but I want to be as detailed as possible for other travelers.  I have never written a review before, but this stay was so unfortunate that I could not go without warning other travelers of this location.  I must preface by saying my partner is a Hilton lifetime Diamond member, so we have stayed at countless Hilton locations all over the country and he stays at a Hilton 50 weeks out of the year. Prior to this trip it was the only brand we chose.  We both agreed this is the worst Hilton we have ever stayed at.  This trip also prompted us to switch to a loyalty program at a different hotel chain going forward.  We booked business travel the following week at a different chain for the first time in many. years.  We arrived in the evening during a rain storm, and the front door was being serviced, so we had to go through a side door--through the rain, with a high and dangerous door frame-- to cut through a conference room to get into the hotel.  The covered car entrance is tight and difficult to get through on a good day, much less a rainy day. 2 cars will fit, maybe 3.  We were given no choice but to Valet, unbeknownst to us that this would be an additional charge.  There is not a parking lot adjacent to the property. I left my bags with my partner in said conference room and made my way down the corridor to find the front desk.  Making my way to the front desk to check in, I noticed no one in the lobby area to greet customers.  I waited for a minute and looked around for someone to help me, and began to leave the desk in search of help.  A gentleman came out from a closed office door and said 'what were you going to do, leave?' before even saying hello.  I was flustered already, so I just stood there and asked to check in.  He checked us in, and I presented a Hilton gift card to use for our stay.  He let me know while laughing that he didn't even know Hilton had gift cards and he certainly couldn't help me with one.  He said I would have to come back the next day when management arrived to use the gift card, and asked for a credit card to secure our stay.  At this point in our trip I had limited funds available, so was forced to use my bank card.  When we got to our room, not only was it much smaller than pictured, there was no soap and very few towels (not enough for 2 people, and not as many as usual in a Hilton bathroom.)  I wouldn't say it felt dirty, but definitely worn down, and I am glad it was only a quick stop before leaving for the airport in the morning.  I read other reviews before booking and was hesitant, but it was on our way back from the Keys so I figured it couldn't be that bad.  It was that bad. At $350+ for one night, we could have stayed anywhere else and I wish we'd gone back to our first hotel of the trip near the airport at half the price.  We were hungry for dinner after we dropped off our things in the room, so we made our way to the lobby to eat in the dining area.  The stench was unbearable, and no one on staff greeted us for 15 minutes.  We called an uber since we had no idea how to get our car, and ate dinner elsewhere nearby.  We returned and went to the bar for a drink before going to our room, and another 10 minutes went by before we were greeted by the bartender who looked our direction but did not say anything.  There were 2 people at the bar besides us, and they were not being assisted.  The next morning is when we discovered we did not have an appropriate number of towels, so I went to the front desk to ask for 1 more.  The attendant said she would send someone from housekeeping.  After 20 minutes with still no towel, I called and she said she was understaffed and would bring one personally.  She did promptly.  I then went to the front desk again to check out, and presented my gift card.  I was again met with an attendant who did not know how to process a gift card as payment, though she was much more apologetic than the attendant the night before.  She said she would have to charge my card, but to email their general manager for the gift card to be applied to our stay.  I emailed the general manager the next day, who took a few days to get back with me.  Once she did she was very helpful in trying to use the gift card for my stay but at this point I was so disappointed with the service that I don't know that anything could have been done to fix matters besides to apply the gift card to our stay, offer a refund, or something of a monetary discount for my trouble.  I must also say I called the Hilton customer service line prior to our trip to ensure the gift card would be able to be used, and they assured me it would.  The gift card was never able to be processed by this hotel and applied to my stay, despite several attempts by both the GM and I to contact customer care.  The issue was not that the GM did not try, but that the hotel was still reflecting as another brand and Hilton would not accept their charge for the gift card. Hilton eventually froze the card and told me I would have to use it at a different location.  At this point I was exasperated, and this is when we decided to find a different hotel chain to use from now on.  Due to the unexpected charges I experienced some unfortunate banking issues, which would not have occurred if my gift card had been honored as I was assured.  To add insult to injury, in the shuffle of coming in a side door and down corridors to get to the front desk, I discovered once I left that I must have placed some prints I had purchased to the side.  I called about these items, which I was told would have been thrown away if they were left behind. They were never located.  I have never had a worse hotel experience, and I would absolutely not recommend this property.  I would actually recommend it close until it is appropriately allocated as a Hilton property, and staff is fully trained.  …",227,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d1503508-Reviews-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Miami_Brickell_South-Miami_Florida.html

We booked the King Suite w/kitchen and additional living space. The location of the hotel is great. Close to shopping, local food and vendors, and convenience stores. Never had any trouble accessing transportation. Our Uber to multiple locations avg $10-15. The hotel’s restaurant food was decent. The business center was 24/7 and access was easy. The front desk staff was civil.   The Bad: For the price we paid for a corner unit suite, we got a subpar unit. There was three things wrong: (1) the pictures online were heavily filtered to make the unit look more updated and grand. IRL it was a very outdated unit that had worn tattered carpet, exposed cables, peeling paint, and grime. (2) The unit had what I’d considered safety issues. There was exposed tacking nails and metal at the thresholds, worn electrical outlet with hanging plugs, and exposed wiring and cables. (3) The bathroom threshold was a trip hazard.   The Ugly: After night one, we lost drinking water from the kitchen faucet. We called maintenance, for nearly 2 hours, maintenance was in and out of our unit to fix the problem. Our trash cans were being used to catch leaking water. Our door had to remain open to allow access to maintenance. At no time did management approach us to communicate apologies or concerns. The problem could not be fix so our kitchen unit had no running water. I had to ask that they comp our drinking water and then still nothing. To compound the issue later that evening we discovered our unit was under the fitness center and there was some less-than-kind person dropping weights for nearly an hour at 11p.

Just came back from a week’s stay there and really disappointed in their housekeeping and breakfast.   We understand housekeeping changed with Covid however travel is back at unprecedented levels. Travellers shouldn’t have to pay inflated room rates for no amenities.  We stayed 7 nights and were told on check in that towels get changed every 2nd day and a total room clean is done on the 7th night. I said that it didn’t make sense as we check out the next day and asked to have it on the 4th night and they said no it was policy.   So us and other travellers were constantly going down to the laundry and getting fresh towels. We aren’t sure what housekeeping did every 2nd day as we never had enough towels for the 3 adults, were missing tissue and toilet paper and we left out the garbage bins in the hall.   On the 7th night they cleaned the room which makes no sense as we checked out at 5:30am the next morning.   Sofa bed - FYI to the hotel that you actually need to check the mattresses and vacuum them. Our family member couldn’t sleep on that mattress. When we pulled it out it was covered in food and hair. Yuck. We threw the sheet directly on top of the sofa instead.   Breakfast - was never enough food for the guests. We tried almost every day at different times and it was always barren..   We like this hotel but it really needs to snap back and be better for the prices they charge.…",110,https://www.tripadvisor.com//Hotel_Review-g34438-d12285436-Reviews-SpringHill_Suites_Miami_Doral-Miami_Florida.html

Spider in the bedroom. Ac filled with dust. Hair in the bathroom and shower. The whole bathroom really looked like it was falling apart. Not to mention there was a literal hole in the wall that you could see outside through. To be fair, it was a small hole, but a hole none the less. Bullet hole perhaps?   My family and I booked this place last minute while waiting for our cruise to depart from the nearby port. What a mistake that was. The pictures are very deceiving. I should have looked at the reviews beforehand.   Staff was rude and dismissive of the hygiene complaints and declined any resolution.

Cabins at Oleta River State Park,campgrounds,"Oleta River State Park, Miami, FL 33160-4460",We stayed Mon-Thr just before Thanksgiving and had a great time. I will share some tips that I wish I had before going.  Plan on cleaning the cabins a little before settling in. There is some level of cleaning done but if you are a clean person you will probably want to do more. There are no brooms or anything in the cabins so bring your own if necessary.  They are strict about not letting you into the cabin much before 4:00 pm even if the cabin has been unoccupied for a week. They did let a member of our group check in at 3:15 and get access to the cabin which was a surprise. We had arrived a little after lunch and were told to come back at 4:00.  There is nowhere to set anything in the bathroom / shower area. There are a couple of hooks and that's it. There are no benches or anything. You have to be creative with your stuff. It's also tricky because you are likely trying to touch as little as possible during COVID times. Other then that the bathrooms are pretty clean and were never crowded when we visited.  Each cabin has both a grill and a fire pit which has a grill that can be moved in or out. I would recommend buying your firewood from the grocery store ($6/bundle). They sell wood in the park as well but it may be from fallen trees and seems to burn faster then the hardwood from the store (Publix). We enjoyed the grills and the fire pits.  There are lots of mosquitos and no see ums particularly at dusk and dawn. Bring spray.  There is a kayak put in very close to the cabins if you bring your own kayaks. We had a great time and found a variety of conditions. There is interior mangrove paddling that is very calm regardless of the winds. There are other areas that can be quite challenging in heavy winds. We had fun on our paddle.  There are a lot of mountain bike trails. The signs say they require helmets. There is also some casual bike riding in the park.  We had raccoons (we think) open up out cooler and take a lot of food. I would suggest bringing your cooler into the cabin or securing it well. We lost a lot of good food at night to the little bandits. There are stores within a couple of miles from the park if needed.   One of the days we did an excursion to Calle Ocho or Little Havana. We enjoyed it and the food was very reasonably priced. There is a  lot of Cuban Heritage to experience. We also visited Wynwood Walls which is a lot of nice murals in a somewhat sketch area. It's fine to drive around but everyone may not want to walk around there at night. It also seems like a decent size area to walk. You could probably walk a few miles to see all of the murals on multiple streets. South Beach is also close by and is an interesting place to experience.…,3.5,#3 of 3 campgrounds in Miami,"We stayed in cabin 1 and the cabin wasn't very clean, but it looked nice.
